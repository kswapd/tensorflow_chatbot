Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Tons
Then that's all you had to say.
I hope so.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Like you care.
You did what?
I guess I'll never know, will I?
It's just you.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
It's a lung cancer issue
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
No, I ' m not.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You get the girl.
Away.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
We're not.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Funny, you're the only one
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
I hate him.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Busy
What are you doing here?
Unwelcome.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Maybe.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
I thought you were punishing me.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Oh yeah.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Yeah.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
See you next week!
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Pirate -- no question.
But -- who -- what --?
Absolutely not.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Excellency, you are right.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
I know.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I am busy inside.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
No?
... for a commoner?
He understands.
You never learned how to speak my language.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
We don't need to know.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Twenty eight.
Immediately.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, I considered it.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
End my career?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
A timer.
Stay with her.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Did you tell him you did?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
There are two bodies found at this point.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
That's good.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.  I promise.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Okay.
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Sit down!
Good idea!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Shut up.  Look!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Credit?
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Alright.  Go ahead.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Excuse me?
No way!  He's mine!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Yeah?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Sure, what is it?
Yes?
Yes.
That seems very unlikely.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Thank you, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Thank you.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Jesus.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
So you took the rest of the night off...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I didn't have the time.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Shit.
What?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
You're hopeless.
I guess he got the message...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Tell me.
Shut up.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
You know exactly where they are!
I'm fucked!
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
I brought the girl remember?
She's an exception..
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
That's what I'm saying.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I'll be right back.
It's like a cab isn't it?
And the third one?
Why not?
I thought you were divorced.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Learning language.
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
Because...
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Options.
Gentlemen?
Only too well... here you must be parched..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Sir!
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
I love you.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I promised him to Machine.
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
I'm not so sure about this.
Any good?
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Yeah.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Show me where you buried her.
Easy enough for you.
I was well compensated.
Never mind how I found you.
I'm asking.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
I'll risk it.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much?
Sounds good, pops.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
See ya.
Nope.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I'm telling you it's not that.
You've found missing persons before.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Okay, I follow you so far...
You're joking.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
It got to be too much for him.
Of course.
We're all like that.
What?
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Who are you?
No... no... no...
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
What?
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Let me talk to you.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
About Freddy?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Been having bad dreams.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
You're right.
No.  A deal's a deal.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Had kind of a long night.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Krueger is reality.
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Well we gotta do something!
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Mark...
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Oh it does???
Seems to be all around...
The frogmen?
Yes, Griff?
What????
Wonderful!
What about time...?
Who with?
Minus three.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Obviously.
Thank you.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Shit! What are we gonna do?
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Hmm.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
How'd you get the job?
In the chest.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
What blood?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
What?
Lawford?
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
To us it was.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Where's the plow?
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
Okay. She's fine.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
But not now.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
When did she die?
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
This town sucks.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Atta-go.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
How was she?
Who?
No thanks. I don't drink.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Not particularly.
That's what you think.
Alice...
Jim... for godsake!
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Daddy...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Did we warn them off?
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Roger.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Stand by.
Tower, here.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
No.
Jim...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Both of you.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
This is the President.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I might still have a few chips left.
Yes, sir.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
I just wish it was that simple.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
Ask Simon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That's right -- premature ejection.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Compute!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I think so.
Negative.
Negative.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
What?
A b...
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Do you have an appointment, sir?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Then Elaine was right.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Well...
But if you'll just give me...
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Yes?
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Huh?
Yes?
Thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Yeah...
That's right.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Yes...
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
And that fits?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Uh, Matthew...
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
To the... to the beach?
Nothing.
You must leave me alone on this.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
What is it?
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Departmental policy.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Well, thanks, I --
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Hear me out...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
I don't know.
Sir?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Alive?
Do it!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Fuck you.
You're just reading me.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
And hope to die?
You're really something, ace.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Newt, wait!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
You might be disappointed.
What??
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
I want to go!
Yes!
Eat my - ah!
You borrowed money from your mother?
I love you! I love you!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
Oh, Stanzi.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Why?
It's killing me.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What for?
He's doing his best.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Michael!
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Well. There it is.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Enchanted, Madame.
I have no idea.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Papa!
Good morning, sir.
Bene.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What is this?
Why not?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Who are you?
How much?
Are you neglecting my request?
What?
We ended in F Major?
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Yes.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Yes!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
What is what?
On the contrary.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Did you try?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Incredible.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
I can't wait.
Who is she?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Bene.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Will you give me a break?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Lovely.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Okay.
A doper werewolf.
I'm freezing.
Pull over.
Jack is dead!
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
I was having a nightmare.
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you see Jack?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Nice to see you.
It's a five-pointed star.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I have no idea.
Do you think it's a dog?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Walk away, Jack.
Not far enough. Come on.
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
What?!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
And what, Sergeant?
We'll find him, not to worry.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
How much?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
What do you mean, help?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Get out, get out!
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why, I needed a—
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Line?
I want to be near you!
My apartment.
Good for you. Come on.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Where is he now?
Yes, thank you.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
No, sir.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Matt, come here!
With what?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
All right, dear.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
wasn't anywhere near this place—
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Jim Younger, I told you--
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
Swear.
Nope.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Exactly.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Tell me.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
You're not scared, are you?
She was European!
I got three.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Yep.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
And I'm the better outlaw.
A trap.
I'm out.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Get buckets!
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
On account of we're robbing it.
I had you covered.  From back there.
My little Web did that?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Heard of him.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Don't care.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Bob's upset.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
No, I --
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
They're making him a hero now.
Yeah Jimmy?
A fair number, Ma.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
You are a hell of a woman.
Last February?
No.
I swear.
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
I just though you were awful cute.
Really?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Yes sir.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
So you can't tell me anything?
I demand action.
What is that?
Vengeance.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Yes.
What do you want, Courtney?
Take it off.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm just leaving.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
There was no ad in the Times.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
No, you...didn't?
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Two at nine? Perfect.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Yes, Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
No, not really.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
What are I doing?
No. I really don't.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Uh huh?
Paul Owen.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
It's no problem
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Thanks.
I know. I'm sorry.
No problem. 
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Don.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Marcus?
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
What am I gonna do?
I can't...I can't find a shelter
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Another Martini, Paul?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
No, Owen.
Yes, it is.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
Milo! What about --?
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Whaddo I do?
Guilt?
What?
Milo --
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
It's gonna get cold.
No.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I am. I am, sir.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Wanna be a part of history?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
'Have a look?
...Worse?
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Keep looking.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
The Day Care?
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
A what?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You mean -- break in?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
What'd he say?
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Let's try #2.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What?!
I don't know.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
You may.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes, Basil?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Hey, Mick!
Why not? It's a question.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
I'm sorry?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Sure.
What?
I'm sure.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Do you want to talk to him?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Of course, luv.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Indeed.
Shut up.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
... love...
... love ...
Have we met?
Sir August...?  What now?
Impossible?
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Rules are made to be broken.
We want to help...!
So am I.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Too many cooks --
'Our revels now are ended.'
I'll never marry you.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
1922. Why the kippers?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
Any other vices?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Barely.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I thought you didn't.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Have we been invited?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Have you any place in mind?
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Not quite.
You're saying I have no choice.
Decontamination -- ?
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
So you say ...
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Where?
I think so, thank you so much ...
This way ...
Perish the thought.
If you say so.
You are, and it's behind you.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Not interested.
The best.
Maybe it had something to do.
She's mine!
Mr. Thomerson.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
But how can I do that?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
But a fabulous cook.
Are you going to have women at your party?
About what?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Good...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
You better not have too much joy.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
What are you talking about, asshole?
That's more like it.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Let's have a toast.
What's going on?
I want women.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
You can tell a man by his friends.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
C'mon. I insist.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Oooooo.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Still drawing a blank.
Who?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Not likely.
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
-- What are you doing here?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
You look great.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Well, you did invite me here.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Homey.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Then who --
Trychticholorate.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Management were pin heads.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Putty? On both doors?
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
Alderman.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
Nah...
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
How 'bout...
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
YEAH!
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
Please.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Look at my lips.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
We was coming to see you.
EUREKA!!
Why?
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I'm wid it.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
What are there character traits?
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Calm down, please.
It's me, Peerless.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Your father is proud of you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
What do you want me to say?
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
You sound like the media.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Where is he?
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
I just turned twenty.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
What do you mean?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
Just a little something' somethin'.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Your cousins go out with him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you had one?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Old fool!
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
HEY!
Shut up, Mueller.
We found him like this...
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
It's... too slow.
I just don't like it.
I didn't shoot West --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Do I?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
That's exactly what he says about you.
You're lying --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Because I was standing next to him.
Maybe he...
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
Well, he's a good soldier.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're drunk --
You're crazy --
Yes.
Why?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
What point?
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
What happened next?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
They got their stories straight.
You couldn't have known --
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Right back where we started.
Isn't this how your story goes?
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Fifty minutes.
You can't threaten me --
What?
Bullshit --
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
We know.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
There's only one I want.
It truly is.
Why?
Don.
No.
Was she nekkid?
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
I know.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Make him stop.
Really.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Okay.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
I think someone hasn't.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
You say...
Story of my life.
Yes. Exactly.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
They're your favorite flower.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I do.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's not true.
He's up with your father.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
What for?
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
No I haven't.
Right.
Uh... Yes.
What are you doing here?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
John.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
So you're just going to be vindictive
Have you got your passport?
I said I don't have any.
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
Why not?
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Why?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
No.
She's dead.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
What was her name?
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's more like a date.
Maybe you will find out.
Right.
Just wanted to see.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh! Gave me a start.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
This gonna get you in trouble?
You didn't have to do this.
You liked what I brung ya?
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
You been home yet?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
How long... how long I been out?
Well I don't...
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
In my house, you watch that lip...
Whose doin' is that?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Let go of me...
We drinkin' buddies now?
I ain't in a hurry.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
What'chu sayin'?
Naw!
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Why she got a chain on her?
Yes'sir.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Rae...
Rae!
Yeah, I do.
You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Charlie...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
What?
Nick, we can't just --
You said that in the last two places.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Give me a break, would you?
Give us a break...
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
You were too far behind.
Gaiijin.
A resort city, Beppu.
What...?  Why?
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Kampai.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You met her.
What do you chant?
Tell them I'm not.
The cheese...
Save it, I already took the tour.
Then take it from him.
Not in that company.
Yeah.
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
He was my partner.
Right.
Do you know what this is?
Look.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
You want him dead too.
If he won't cooperate?
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Why?
I am?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
You're androids.
Like what?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Thank you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Garbage man?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
I know all that.
Do you have something against science?
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
It's okay.  Forget it.
I gotta piss.
Sorry.
I'm doing okay.
These aren't just...
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Me too.
Of course.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
You mean the snake.
And who do I go to about you?
Of course not.
Why should I be?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Me and my dad.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
You mean a woman?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Go ahead.
Thirteen.
Five, maybe six.
Of course.
Hi.
I don't have one.
They left.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Really?
Come where?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Oh, brother...
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Yes, I'm right?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
I haven't brushed yet.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
The big one!
Two weeks.
That's what I was afraid of.
Is this your house?
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Do I look crazy?
Good-bye!
No way.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Thanks.
Sing it to me.
Yes, Eve?
It was at least as good as the sky.
Yes, it is.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No. Sit down.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
I promise. Is that all?
I'll try.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
True.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Bye, Adam!
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up there!!
How do you do, ma'am.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I'll be all right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
A psychiatrist?!
Yes.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
The locks.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What?
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
I thought ten years.
Some time.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I knew you'd like him.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I think...it...works.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Those sluts!
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
What?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Roger, Wolf One.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
You did? A human ear?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Only you and the photo lab.
Yes sir.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Yeah.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Never before this.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Please, please stay.
I sure don't hate you.
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Just get outta my bed.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
No.  Hi baby.
Who, Dorothy?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Mommy's here.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
No thanks. What does that mean?
What?
Nothing.
Yes.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
This is it.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Uh-uh.
Yes.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Where are they?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Where to?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
No Jeffrey!!
Stop it Mike.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Go find one.
Yes mother.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
BLAME...
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Be careful.
Right.
Aye.
How many?
Shut it. It's Ma.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
For what?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
A bit.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
A-fuckin'-men!
It is your corrupt we claim.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Uh... two shooters!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Where's my cat?
You... oh god, why?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The fat man.
What about one guy with two guns?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Why was I not informed of this?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Sweet-n-low!
Shit! Shit!
Who were the victims?
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I'll be back at 9:00.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Open it!
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Just go!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That sets it off.
Nothing. Go ahead.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Like he meant it.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
I keep it for emergencies.
Look at the treads on those.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Bob?
It's not a plan. It's just --
No. We didn't.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
OK.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
I know.
Ah. Couple days ago.
What is it?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Get out of the way.
Roger.
Nobody move!
Let's go. Come on.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
We're not sure.
What do you mean?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
How?
Dignan, I --
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
So do I.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Death.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
See you, Bob.
Move.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
I'm not playing any more golf.
No, I don't mind.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Jesus Christ! No.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Sure.
You're Anthony?
The front stairs.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
I'll just drive my car.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
God DAMMIT.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
I can't do that, Bob.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Now!
I'm working on it.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
No, my friend knows her.
There was a mistake.
Anything else?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
The sooner the better.
What do you have, Danny?
Keep going...
Then what?
Felt a little light.
I don't know who that is.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I did.
I worry when you get like this.
The Telegraph office.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
Tell me later.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
You do?
Who is Pamela Landy?
What is this, a game?
I killed him???
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Your first assignment was Geneva.
What's that?
I'm working on it.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
That's where we came out.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Me? Four years.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
We must sue for peace.
We cannot defeat this --
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
He will. I know he will.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
The Scots will fight for us?
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
I rest.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
We don't split up!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Thank you for inviting.
I... accept your proposal!
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
...I wouldn't know.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I must... consult with my father.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Cute, Evan.
Fix?
Can you protect me?
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Weirder than this?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Not in this wing, actually. No.
No, protecting her.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
Where are my goddamn books?
But I... I need those books.
What the fuck are you doing?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Like how?
I walk differently?
I get it. You can drop it now.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Gee, thanks friend.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Oh my God oh my God...
I came with Captain Renault.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
-- Will he keep his word?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Well?
What is your name?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Yes, sir.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
You needn't be concerned about me.
I will.
And I was wondering.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Richard, I had to see you.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
No.
And Laszlo?
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
And I said I would never leave you.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Won't you join us?
Goodnight.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
-- Yes?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Thank you. I try.
What of it?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes, I get the point.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
May we proceed with the business?
-- Thank you.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Thank you.
I expected no less, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Perhaps.
But everybody's having such a good time.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
What, again?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Yeah? What's his name?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Excuse me.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
-- Thanks. I will.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Take your hands off me!
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Put that phone down!
-- You thought what?
No.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Yeah?
No, I don't.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Take it, damn it.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
You are.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
No.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
I had it on the island with me.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Let's take a look.
I thought I did.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He's your cute thing.
You want to.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
My epitaph.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
And how was your Christmas?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
I braided them.
Forty-three days.
To Wilson.
What?
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Permission granted.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Dr. Homer Wells.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Good night, Daddy.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Nothing.
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
Please don't...
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Have you enlisted?
Really! Is it serious?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
What about the trees?
I guess so...
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Yes, for both.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Nobody's named this one yet.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I'm happy I amuse you.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Two million.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Isn't it always?
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
It's not true.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Two million.
She's up for it.
You sure?
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Help me.
We're not cops.
You interested in a little work?
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Sounds respectable.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
What do you want? An apology?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
You sure?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
With identification.
I'm sorry.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Keep it up.
What?
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I try.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Roger that.
That's what I'm talking about.
Jack Manfred.
It's the tension.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What's the Blue Book price?
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
How did you land that?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I don't know.
Tension. It'll go.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Do you have to swear all the time?
What about a drink on the way home?
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Leave it.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
That's fine.
You choose.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
You're serious.
I can't do it, Jani.
I told you, all bets are off.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
Jack! It's Jani.
Have I?
You've done pretty well.
You're talking about complicity.
That bitch? No.
Don't worry.
I'll tell you later.
I was at Beadles.
Five.
I don't gamble.
Fine.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Oh, God...
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Well, there's the possibility of...
All right, then...
I read the same here.
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Armed.
Hello, bomb.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
To explode, of course.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
I hereby name this star Fred.
Ah, negative drop.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I like it up here.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
No kidding?
Ah... pity, pity...
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Talk to the bomb.
Yeah.
I'm on a break.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
That's a lotta crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
What the hell are you doing?
Leave.  Now.
You mean until you showed up?
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Later.
Can you help me get her back?
I don't want to move away.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Yeah...
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How much do you know?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
A girl.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Open it.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
You're also a fool.
Let go of my hand.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
What?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I was on call. 
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Right, slow...
You got in the car, didn't you?
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
One more time in English.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Nah. Couldn't be.
The easy way.
Check.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
NOW!
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
That's it?
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
The KISS Army!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah.
Yeah, you did!
GOOD MORNING!
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Donnie! Give it back!
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
I don't wanna talk about it.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Until it withers away.
Yeah?
And what?
Who?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
It's safe here.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
That is a terrible nickname.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
No.  That's stupid.
Yes.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
The good stuff.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Frank is going to kill.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Yeah.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
You're not a bitch.
That's enough.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I guess they made him do it.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
But now you can't go.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
I stole four beers from my dad.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Thank God for bunge cords.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
I love you much.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Yeah...
Then it must be Wednesday.
I know.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
What?
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
He should be king!
The king can do no wrong! 
"My"...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Send for my car...
But you're my father -
None of your business...  Take another letter.
Yes, sir. 
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yankee Poodle.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Did you shoot the rapids?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
You told it to me.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
And Vera niece, too.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Now -- er --
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
This is terrible!
Oh, would you...?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Oh?
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
No, I think a whiskey.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Did you see it?
What is it?
Shut up!
What do you mean?
I intend to.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You don't own this man!
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
You've never been?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh no, my friend...
Yes.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
My name is...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Thank you very much.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
That's a canopy, John.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Ah! It's my father!
But, Father, it IS!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What are what?
Yes.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
And the week before that?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
I... but I...
It is day, of course, Freya.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
I'm sure it's lovely.
REALLY?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Well, how d'you think I feel?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Don't talk nonsense.
The important thing is not to panic.
What -- rape?
Oh, get it over with.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Aaagh! Rape!
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Come on, move it!
Very deep... usually...
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Why should WE care?
Like fish.
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
I've got you!
Oh... er... yes...
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What are you talking about?
We'd be the first!
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I have to go...
What do we have to do?
That's it!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Like you got rid of Snorri!
So did your father...
Just a little overworked, maybe.
No one.
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Hi.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Yeah.
No.
No, not at all.
You'll call me, right?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Would you get me another, Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I don't know.
What do you mean?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Is that what you want?
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah, like that.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
What are you doing?
Tomorrow?
What if?
Hey, Joel --
I don't know.
I can't stop thinking about you.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Well... I did.
You take it. I don't know.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
You found us okay?
We haven't checked.
It's a good one all right.
What?
You better go.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
He went home sick.
Oh dear.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Yeah.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
What guy?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Yep.
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
A job for me?
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Justin?
Hold on, Coop...
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
It is not.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Nothing. It's nothing.
Thank you.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What's on your mind?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Yes, sir!
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
What you got, Peters?
...how's the client?
Justin.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
It's complicated...
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
What makes you think I'll miss?
You know.
Better if I just show you.
NOOO!
Locked and cocked.
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Yes, sir.
Love to.
Starck, give me a read.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
What is it, Smith?
Radiation interference?
But you can breathe it.
How much oh-two do we have?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
No. It was someone else.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
...repeat, we're armed...
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
1000 meters...
Get them back --
How?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Ship's log.
I can't believe we built this.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
It wants me. I have to go.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's easy for you to be patient.
Victor must've taken him.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Youthful high spirits.
He's made a few changes.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
Right, whatever, have fun.
Girl...?!
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
And reverse the mutations --
Of course. Of course.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You need a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Susan. What are you doing?
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Arnold. What's happening?
You want to work at Carl's?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
It's the first door on your left!
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Why can't you do it?
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Dad says!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Well...
So are you.  Are you shaking?
You first.
You should work for yourself.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Yeah?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
That's me, Merv.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
This ain't no cop.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
What should I do?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
What's the big deal?
There's nothing to it.
Climax together.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
What do you want?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
How about your phone number?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Oh... yes.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Two more Cokes.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to come inside?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you really have to go?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Yes... It makes sense.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Not for me.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Crying? Why was she crying?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
A major!
Naw! Not a major.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Las Vegas.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Jesus! Did I say that?
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
Damn right!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
What for?
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Are you ready?
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Some of what?
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
There's a tunnel.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Follow me.
Shit!
The door... on three.
Just an observation.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
What?
What's in the back?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Okay then.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Sure.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Holds four.
Seven.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
F-f-fuck you.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
If he doesn't shut up...
Get something on that.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
BONSAI!
Nothing, just lookin'.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Wait God-dammit!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
I'm fine, I really am.
Oh...
I'm not lying.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Claire?
You want his name?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
See you next weekend, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
I know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Fifteen.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Enh.
What?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Whattaya think you're in now?
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
I'm not sure.
Just a little way.
Yes.
What'd you do?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Fine!
Who're you?
'Golden Boy.'
You got it.
Yes, Ma.
Then why did you bring them?
You kill me, Mama.
What's wrong?
Yes, Mama.
Mama...?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
I have!
But what -- 
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
The music? Or the fire?
Worse.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
A brain. Extremities.
I will not! Kill me now!
There, there... shhh...
It's been months. It's not like him.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
I'll have to do better than that.
All my life I've known.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
It wouldn't dare.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Aye, Captain.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
As a march hare.
Can you think of a better reason?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Why?
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
You know of it?
No, no, they're all dead...
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I will protect you.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Tomorrow is another day.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
You okay?
Wet. I don't know.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I had to.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
A short somewhere.
I don't believe you...
Whatever you make yourself.
Lead the way!
Umhummmmph.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
So let's do it.
Thank you, son.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes, they do.
Yes.
Yes.
No, I didn't.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
To yours.
Yep.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
It's a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
No!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Knock yourself out.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
No.
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
Feels good.
Cops.
What?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Where are you?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Yeah, it's mine.
That's what I hear.
Who's "we"?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Your prerogative, Senator.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Didn't take long.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
What changed?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
Sir?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Which is guy-speak for...
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Yeah.  Me too.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
That's a good story.
I think you look beautiful.
Just askin'
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Maybe half.  Not even.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
15, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
So am I.
O'Neil, Jordan.
The first female President?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Sure. I'd like that.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I got pretty close.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
What do I get?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Call me Charlie.
It's your choice.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
That's right.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
Sounds like a big company.
Oh.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Makes us look more American.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Good idea.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's Raymond.
Just don't.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Like YOU know?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
The ships are gaining...
Could they be the miners?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Down there.
What?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
We'd never have the budget for this.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
We need another one.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
We're doing episode 31?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
What the hell are you talking about?
Right.
Gwen...
Mark 12.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
NO, Thank God he has not.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
Well... Sort of...
But there it is!...
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
And a French alliance?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
No one knows...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Who's in command out there?
Lafayette is a child!
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Detained by what?
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
They help me understand why we fight.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I only meant...
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
It is; we need you George.
You know very well who it is that I love.
That's a lie!
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
Or, 'civilized'.
Well, we must be who we must be...
Just because they are born?
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You're right.
So you didn't have the key with you.
You spotted them, huh?
I have to ask you for that key.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
What money?
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
What've you got?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
But you work for the casino?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Read it. It's a grabber.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
I found him.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
I'm up twelve grand today.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Don't go out of your way.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Oh.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Be quiet and listen.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
What money?
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Thanks.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Why not.
Or uninvited guests.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Gimme a break.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
It looks like it.
How about you Epps?
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Because of the gold.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Same. Any luck?
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
But where's the damage?
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
I don't know, are we?
That much I think we've already established.
Epps, over.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Alright. I'll be right up.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Maybe.
Lost my sea legs.
You've been out for about a day.
A what?
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
How should I know?
Who?
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
So what do you think?
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
Huh?
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Jesus...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
That's just the way I am!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
How perfect.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
You loser!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
I dunno...
Come on, it's too late now...
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Somewhere downtown.
What, is she black now?
Let's go hassle Josh.
As always.
JOSH!
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Where did you get that?
No way... when?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Like what?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Don't worry.
Go ahead...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You're insane.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
So should I come over?
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
That's all you're bringing?
It just came yesterday...
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Nothing.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Seymour does.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Indian records?
Sure, I guess.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Oh, right...
Yeah, well...
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Shh!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Just wait here.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Why?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Really?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
So, do you like me, Seymour?
I had to see you.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What about this?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Why? What did she tell you?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Why don't we start with that next week?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Then we agree. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
What?
So that's what a lion looks like. 
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Good night, Janosz.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
I won't.
Didn't I do it?
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Okay, let's take a look.
Thanks.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Same difference.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Now you're talking.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Okay.
Tonight?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Command me, lord.
-- the sorrow --
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Yes.
Get on with it, counselor!
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Something good --
No, the slime is rising.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
Wonder what?
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Eight o'clock?
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
I am Zuul.
All right.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Talk to my accountant. 
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
I think it's the food of the future.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Are you Peter Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
The magic word is "please."
See!  They are using drugs.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
What have you got, Egon?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
I'm always serious.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
We'd better adjust our streams.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
That appears to be the case.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What do we do now?
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Mmmhmmm.
Judgement Day ...
Right.  We'll believe anything.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
What are you talking about?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Not yet, dear brother...
Gladly Caesar.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
I don't know...
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Sneaking around with your brother?
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Would that Marcus had lived.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Well, we can try...
My troops don't make policy.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
You teach them!
Chain him.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
No.
I'd love some.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Yes, I do.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Ah. Where?
At the Zoo.
I've never been to it.
What did she say?
You've got to tell me what she said.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
If you want.
I don't understand.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Yes.
No, Benjamin.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Not exactly.
Who screamed?
You heard me. Out of here.
Because I don't like you.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Will you bring it in to me?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
What? No. Nothing.
What?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
That's right.
What?
Why not?
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
So?
I know that. But I'm --
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Why is it?
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Waiter!
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Benjamin.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
This is all terribly wrong.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Go ahead then.
What novel did you read.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
Not exactly.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Is it?
No.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
What?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
I was just kidding around.
Benjamin?
I wouldn't know.
Now don't start this.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
But if it's sickening for you --
You don't have to say that.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Where is Elaine?
Sir?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
What about it?
To be what?
That has nothing to do with it --
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
How long have we known each other now?
Quite a while.
I'd like to hear it.
Mr. Robinson?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Why?
Yes, I can.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Why?
Not with strangers.
Will you do me a big favor?
Would you like to make a man happy?
I feel sorry for him.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Why do you hide in my room?
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Yes -- I do understand.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
You are beautiful!
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
What?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Shall I see you again?
For Vienna?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
Why do you think --
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
No, doctor.
The Grand Hotel.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Can't you understand me?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
All you have to do is phone for it.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
Then, it's all over?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Good morning, Madam.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
You haven't time.
I could not think of not accepting.
-- We must do something...
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
No news yet?
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
What is?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
That's right.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Scram. Go home.
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
All? It ain't bad.
I want to know everything about you.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Oh, don't be stupid.
We'll rent a car.
I'm a salesman.
And when he got serious?
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Open your door.
) What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Not many.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
The cemetery...
Care to join me?
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No shit.
You sure?
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
John...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Then you come out here.
I'm okay.
Who?!
What?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
He says things.  Bad things.
You can't expect us to stay here --
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
He's gone.
Kara, no!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
It was you.
Samhain.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No one.
Didn't recognize you.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Must have changed that law.
Oh, shit.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
Go home!
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You.
I forget mine for years on end.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
You actually sold insurance!
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Thank God!
Are you--do you--
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Dr. Woodly.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
"The sting."
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
No, no, no, no, no.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Can't it keep till morning?
Will you go to bed?
Make it fast.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
No.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Situation.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I have a brain.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
What a honeymoon.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
No.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
It's always locked.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
He's dead, you know.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
I've got to run!
I've literally got to run!
I came back.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I've never heard of it.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Correct.
We'll find out now, won't we?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
I'm utterly satisfied.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
If you want to be found that way.
I've enjoyed being man.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
What will you do, Colonel?
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
I'll kill myself.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Stay home tonight!
He's alive!
I was afraid to ask.
It's beautiful.
No.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Keeps fairies away!
He isn't any friend of Father.
Doing what?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
That's something I suppose.
I know.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
How long has this been going on?
You're saying no.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
Tonight's the night.
That's the XKE.
He's not your son.
We met here earlier this evening.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Goodbye.
Penelope!  We're late!
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
Do you want to take a session?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Wait?
Okay.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
That's all you got, three girls?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Sam?
Do you know where she would be?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Three hundred?
Huh?
'Sucking off.'
You don't understand shit.
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
Not very.
Tijuana.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
On your own land?
But what?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Where is he?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
What are you paying me for?
Hmm.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
Pretty good.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
Yeah.
Well...
Ratan!
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
What exactly do you have in mind?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Oh.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Where are the papers?
Wait here.
What kind of a car is it?
I'm a file clerk.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
What?
Eh, no.
Oh.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
No.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
My door is always open.
Yes. Very much.
Certainly a new experience for me.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
But what?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
But I don't play anything.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
I don't know.
Yes. It's almost there.
Well, don't go.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Here.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
But why now?
It's true. I can't live without you.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Perhaps it is.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
A rough estimate.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
You think so, sir?
Harold!
She took my head.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
It certainly is.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
What are you talking...
It's been Hell.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
You were ALL human!
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Story of my life.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
See? I don't like that --
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
From where??!!
No. It's not.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
You're doing fine.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Anung-un-Rama...
I can live with that.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
No. Don't --
You call that thing a cigar??
My arm is fine. Where are you??
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
Shh! Just a second.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
Goodnight.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Red, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Sure.
It'll go in.
Uh-huh.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
You can keep them.
I don't remember.
Kirsty?
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh my God.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Good.
Hell...
You're still afraid.
And the blood let you out?
Hi. I got soaked.
The keys are in the kitchen.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You mean we're moving in?
No. I'm not.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Can I get you anything?
Sure.
No. I'll do it.
I don't know where to begin...
Am I?
What happened to me?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Steve.
Daddy?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
O.K.
You like?
Surprise.
Sure.
I've forgotten.
What?
Of course.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Finished?
Gone?
I have to get out.
She's so damn... English.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
Are you alright ?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
Really.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Well what's the point in that?
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
What do you mean, "what?"
Ehh.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
How do you know about that?
Suck my ass.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
So?  You even said they're good.
I have all of the others.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
You can be and are wrong.
We work there!
He's not worth it!
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
-- FUCK OFF!
Do it.  Do it.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
You look upset.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
I should be so lucky.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
And do you like it that way?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Just the obvious stuff.
What, what?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Just ask it!
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I guess.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I don't have your number.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
I don't want to go back.
C'mon.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
Harder.
I'm alright.
Wanna go to dinner?
I mean it.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
You called this morning?
It's true!
What difference does it make?
Enough of what?
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Thank you.
Yup.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Nor have you!
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
That way.  You?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Well we don't.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Sure.
Fine.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
No one knows you're here?
You're a fool.
Not all of them.
Yes.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
A factor of age.
You won't.
That would be difficult to explain.
You killed those other two.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
You kill with your left hand?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
The inheritance.
Yes.
Now there's a new topic.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Please go to no trouble.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
You know me home.  Me name.
No!
This is madness!
No!
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
But why be so concerned about me?
Of course.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
What would you like?
Like you.
Certainly not me.
Tradition.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
We need more time.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
We have no understanding.
Stay out of it.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Where did you learn that?
Figure she's with him?
You'd think he'd had practice.
And the Bulgarian?
What are you doing here?
I've had a few more concerns.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
I presume it's a sword.
A mystery.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
We were very close.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'm sure that's true.
Just your pappy scared some.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Where'd she go?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Where are we going?
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
No, you don't!
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
The power of the press, huh!
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
What?!!
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
The insurance business?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Hold on a minute.
Yes. Where is he?
I know, but --
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Is he coming back here?
Was she? Did you notice?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Murder, uh?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Walter, you can't do that!
You -- you!!
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
You said it!
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
What do I know about Williams?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Fred!
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I did.  Hold the wire.
Throw him out, Frank.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I was just going to!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
All right, Judge.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Shut up, you!
Forty dollars.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
But Grandpa, you said...
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Looking for shrapnel.
What's that?
I don't mind.
Sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
Could.
We thought it was poison.
Pauline.
He's the worst liar.
...and six...
Well, for the baby, really.
The sodding water table.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
You need trees for an avenue.
You taste it.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
Look after yourself, Grace.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Come on.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Nice.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Now, what makes you think that?
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I don't.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
What's that?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Turn that fucking radio off!
It's a girl.
Where ya headed?
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Quiet.
It won't work.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Oh.
When?
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
She looks like she stinks.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You find something, Georgie?
Keys.
What do they call you, sweety?
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
You said it, not me.
What!
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
I um... no, I don't think so...
What! God damn, how many?
Well, go get her.
Where we headed?
And think about what you've done.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Not at all.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
When you were a little French girl?
That would be good.
Yes. Happy happy.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Hmmmph.
Not in front of the boy.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
No. You look so beautiful.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
I don't know. Something's missing.
We still have you and I.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Ouch. Yeah?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Three foot one.
Nathan told my brother.
Ready!
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Paper or cloth?
I'm not sure.
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'll be out in a minute.
What?
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
You are an animal.
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Have you?
That was wonderful!
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Lila?
Even better.
here, here.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Two.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
I don't know.
You want me to tell her for you?
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Aaaahhhh!
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
I don't want it.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Eddie...
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Talk to me, Charlie.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Is that what you think?
Yeah. Just like that.
Glad to meet you.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Oh no, nothing for me.
You're a pretty good player.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Eight o'clock.
Thanks. I will.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm not.
I drink.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
At school. It's Thursday.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Haven't you opened it?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's this supposed to mean?
Is he a winner?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Yes, I'm glad.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Why should I?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
He went off someplace.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Let's go.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
You lived like this once.
With them?
Yes.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
I guess you could say that.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
Good night.
Why, yes.  Why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
Yes.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I don't see anything.
Who are you calling?
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
The back door was open.
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
All right.  I'll be right back.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
What's the bad news?
Haven't you been watching?
I'm thinking.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
Dad, don't start.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
They don't know this.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
College nickname.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
And our troops here?
But what, General?
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Roger.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
No Sir. Definitely not.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
He's my angel.
No. Exotic.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Above American soil?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
All your life.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
What?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
What?
Mine, too.
Don't know. Think of something.
I came to get you! What do you think?
Good point.
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah?
Look, can we discuss this later?
I came here to save you.
Don't worry. He won't.
Head for the fireplace!
Brody's this way.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Penitent. Penitent...
Who are you?
Come on -- come on!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Just a statue.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
The old man saw it in a dream.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Their children?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
It's pulling me deeper!
It's starting to let go!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Don't catch cold.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Willie!
Yes, they believe you.
I'm...inside you.
Where are we?
Where are we now?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
That a new Datsun?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You said it.
With a man in my head...
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Oh...Gooood!
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
I am. You are.
You gotta help.
I'll sue.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
I'm at the airport.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
What am I supposed to do?
We get on a plane.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
What is it?
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
What? What do you mean?
Follow it.
You're out of shape.
What can I do? You're on your own.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
What?
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Rene...
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
This...is not going to work out.
It is my business. It's my name.
That place. By the window.
Who, me?
What if she says something important?
What am I supposed to do?
I can't keep up.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
You were with GRUNER!
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Well...?
While he makes the run.
I can't handle that thing.
Where've you been?
Yeah, sure.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
Dieter?
Don't worry.
Let us get to the border!
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
Then how did you know?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
Yes. Joe.
We insist.
And how do you service foreigners.
I think I've heard of you.
Here?
I don't know Who.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Been complaning of hallucinations.
I noticed you staring.
Sir?
Yessir...very good sir.
Nothing.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
...right here too.
Without what?
...Rene.
It's not apparent.
I am sort of scattered.
You talk to yourself.
And you, what do you like?
Why'd you run off?
No.
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
Ryuji and Gruner.
Can you?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
They asked about you.
I love you too.
You're gonna laugh.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
You are, I've seen you.
If he was able, what would he say.
Why'd you invite me here?
A drink...
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Thank you.
Yes, baby?
Lowell?
How long?
I'll be there.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
I'm not touching my film...
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Did I tell you you were wrong?
What's the difference...
Who's calling?
Did you say Berman?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
What do you mean?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
What?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Far as you go where?
If you want to do it.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Good.  You have kids?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
What?!
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What?
She's okay.
There is -- there is no family.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
It acts as a...
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Howard!
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who's the pigeon?
Is that... one person?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Yes?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Isn't everything?
Did you see the tape?
What does your lawyer think?
I know you do.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
So I hear. Is that all?
Have you tried the duck?
Miles?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Thank you.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Me. Yes.
Your mother was.
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes.
Oh Miles!
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
I love you. I want to have your baby.
May I come in?
You can't prove anything.
That's blackmail.
Marylin?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Marylin!
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
He has a reputation for being tough.
Oh, God!
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Hello Miles.
I want to be exposed.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
She always looked out for me.
Video.
What are they?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
HA!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Mother?
Who's "Patty."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Muriel Rumsey.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The reward.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
I'll get it annulled.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Oh, yes. I heard.
No.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Is that his name?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
I suppose so.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
Lower the boats!
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
What happened to your money?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Yes.
I found it on the seat.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Shut up!
Are you talking to me!
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Not at all. 
Outside!
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
What are you talking about?
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Well, you were!
No.
You're prejudiced.
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
was—but—
Try me.
Hitch-hiking.
Raw?
You're an expert, I suppose.
Oh, no!
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Yeah!
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Yeah.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Yeah.
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Okay, pete. 
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I dunno.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Who?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Hey, you!
Yeah—wouldn't it?
Why—no—
No.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
What was so appealing about Houston?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
There were admirals.
What?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
David Ferrie.
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
We need him back.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
His name?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Splendid, love to see them.
Germany.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Yes.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Not a problem.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
I'll call her.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
She almost sounds scared.
She wants to go back to work.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Take your time.
Can you do it or not?
What's her name?
Okay.
In cash.
Why does it need to be dark?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Shit.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Cash poor?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Uh-huh.
'74, I think.
Why?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's not really something I think about.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Why?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
In the bag underneath.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
What's he doing?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
What the fuck is that shit?
Can I smoke?
What are you doing?
You two meet?
You talk to him?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
What's her story?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
So what happens now?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Keep it between us girls?
I knew it.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
All your money's in Mexico.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
But you don't?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
So we need two people, two women.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I can do that.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
I need to talk to you alone.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Sure.
Susanville.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Yeah.
No.
We had done time together already.
No.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You lived in Japan, when?
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
You live with him.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Yeah, down the end.
This one.
Who's your partner?
Are you serious?
I dunno.
That was Beaumont.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Did you get it?
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Have fun.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Haven't a clue.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Did the police contact you?
Beaumont worked for you.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Git your ass in here.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
Have her bring the money here.
You expect me to just walk in there?
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I know where it is.
No.
Yes.
'Ola!
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Then what are you doing here?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
How do you know?
Stop!!!!
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
That's right. We did.
There's nothing to expose.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
No. Not really ...
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
How do you know?
What?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
I don't know what to say.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Jacob Singer.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
It's freezing.
Go to sleep.
What do you mean?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
They're weird names.
A good lay.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Why you left.
How's it going?
Why do you bring her up?
Where are we?
Show me Della!
Get your clothes off.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Am I home?
What?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
It might be for me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
Stick with me, kid.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Mid-town mostly.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
The Ladder?
What is it?
I don't know.
Just relax.
No. I couldn't.
I no from around here.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Total delirium.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
I need to see you, Jake.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
He doesn't like it.
Speaking of which, duck!
Pause play.
Yes it does.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
No.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Thorgan, pull us in.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
And now we're all out of it.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
You got that right.
You just keep an eye out.
What?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
I'm pulling, damnit!
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Were you close to your father?
I think so, why?
I get it.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
I'm on my way.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
Would you?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
You killed him?
Oh shit! There he is!
Ow!
Who are you apologizing to?
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
I love you.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Ssh.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
See you then . . . doctor.
Obviously so.
Nanotechnology.
Get him out of there!
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Old Earth?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Sure but what good will that do?
My boat's neat, dad!
I know who he is...
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Do you see the kids?
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Thank you.
Why?
Let's all have a drink.
Florida license plate.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
What do we do?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
I can't imagine why.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
You're leaving?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Transplants?
Let me see your hands...
Anti-Shark cage.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
I'm okay...
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
So that's cool with you, then?
But you copy my work every week.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
What?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
Yup.
No... I guess not.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
What are you talking about?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, more commercial stuff.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Yeah?
You don't have to do that.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Why?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What?
No?
But you're old!
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
You're pregnant?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Thundercats are go!
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Unfortunately, yes.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
It was magnificent, man!
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Share the love, Tits!
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
A Pilates machine?
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Hm.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Looks like it, yeah.
Carrie.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Yeah.
So you don't do any of those things.
Could I try that?
Sure.
What's Early been in jail for?
...Anything else?
Jeez... Adele!
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
As many times as it takes.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Turkey mostly.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Who?
Dahlia, no.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
What happened to Adele?
Thank god!
The party?
...just like that?
Why?
Funny, very funny.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I don't know.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
Everybody just shut up!
...You're hurting me...
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Who are you?
Without his car?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Right.
Yeah.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
Den less go Joe.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
The cartoon?
Yep.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Why I do what?
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Nothen' B.
Right here.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Na.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Right now?
You have?
You were?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
She won't? Why not?
Nothing?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
What?
No.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Passion...
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
I only did it once and...
No. I just gotta go find him.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah is dissdee?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Oh god. That's horrible.
But then I won't need your money.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Nah.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
To come?
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What?
How'd you get in here?
I was at the beach.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Run it down.
Local?
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
I haven't got time for this.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You're not going to tell me that.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
The game's over.  You lost.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Very good.  How did you know?
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
He already did once.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Nothing.
Who's Kathy?
No prints.
But we heard him.
Meaning?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
What did he mean by Huxley?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
It doesn't make sense.
No.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Yes.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Getting too hot in here for you?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead now.
Another kind of game?
This isn't a game.
How can you look at it so clinically?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Why?
You're not?
No.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Then show me who you are.
You've got to face the things you feel.
What do you want on it?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
About what?
Colwyn.
I know it.
All directions are the same here.
Yes.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Does the Queen live?
I have no extraordinary powers.
The Fortress moves?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
You will know, in good time.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
He saved our lives.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
You will follow me.
Not sleepy, either?
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
And mine goes with you.
No.
I have a cinnamon bar.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
It's right behind you.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
It is no trickery.
Yeah.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Good.
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Perfect.
OK.
No.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Don't you like me?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Mathilda, listen!
I have no fear.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Salute.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
I won't let you die.
That's enough.
I'll kill you!
Can it kill me?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You're talking to me?
You've just decided, is that right?
It'll make it.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
About my love for her.
Not our problem.
You tell stories?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
By car right?
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Maybe.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Yes.
Tomorrow.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
Why know?
Where am I?
Steph.
Good morning.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Forty-seven years.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
What?  Who are you?
What do you think I should get?
No.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
To death?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I've been all right.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
No.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
How?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Because they got wet.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
I'm so happy for you!
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
You're kidding!
You think?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Margot!
Neat.
Maybe not to your face...
No, she can't move for an hour.
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
I'm quitting.
Oh, my God!!
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Your what?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Then what? My boobs are too big?
No.
Uh -- sure.
I gave her my word, Warner.
Really?
Three months.
Chuck.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
What do you want from me?
I see...
I don't expect you'd understand.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Or looked so beautiful...
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Gump, is it?
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I fear she's lost.
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
And who might that be?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Careful, lad.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We'll find it.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
No... but what choice have we?
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Don't get too far!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Where?
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
If you like.
Unicorn?
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Be patient.
Are you honest?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
My father and the Baron.
My own father...
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Lili... I love you!
Pinching me!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Is she fair, this princess?
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Sorry.
Only that?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Up ahead!
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
He was there and then he wasn't!
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
Mom said I should.
I would have anyway.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
I couldn't sleep last night.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Nope.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
What did you think it would be?
He jumped into the ocean.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
What are you talking about?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Will he talk to me?
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
It's thirty feet.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You have everything?
You don't have a choice.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
It'll be fine.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
Oh, okay.
A friend of yours is here.
Don't.  I don't want it.
What do you know about me?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
I need you to do me a favor.
She's a little sad, is all.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Where is he?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What did you do with your dog?
Where will you live?
I want him with me.
I don't have a phone.
I can't leave the house?
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
What have you been before today?
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
You're not well.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I smiled at him.
I'd rather you not be here.
Left you?
What?
It's not my back that's killing me.
You got any weed?
I could use the money.
Who?
The payoff.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
What?
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Do you like red?
Why?
I didn't go in your room.
Why?
I just thought it would be nice.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Yes, it is.
And the baby?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
But you can't.
Is Spanky here?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Yes, sir.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What'd you say?
Yeah, I want some pie.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
What about you, Radio?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
'Course I was right. About what?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm all right.
You killed Santa Claus?
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Are you offering me a bribe?
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You found him.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
All right. Let me out.
So excited.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Definitely.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
The Dark Prince is here.
That way.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
I'll just go to Heaven.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
My dad's an optometrist.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
School?
Basically, yeah.
Why would you be floating?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
See something you like, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Just the face.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
I'm in my party mood.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Anybody we know?
How a Sandman lives.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
K.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
It's different now. Help me.
I let him go... believe me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
They won't believe us.
We'll convince them.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I doubt it.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
To what?
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Yes...
No.
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No, no, no
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Too little.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
No, I'm okay.
What?
This is our bedroom.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
No. Fred hates them.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah.
His or ours?
You know what I think?
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Pete... Don't...
Oh, yeah?... What else?
We killed him.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Do ya good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Yeah? what did they want?
What happened to me?
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
No, sir, it's not.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
What about yesterday?
Coming up.
I don't know yet.
Alice who?
I like to laugh, Fred.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Maybe.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Yeah?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Just a minute.
He's got some fucked up friends.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
What?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Yeah.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Sorry... I...
I don't want to talk about it...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Will you stop squawking!
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
All right.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Leaving?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
They were.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
The only one.
Shall we have another?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Splendid!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Father Perrault is dead.
Yes.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Hey!
Are you the High Lama?
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Yes.
Dead?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
My name's Sondra.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Why?
I'd love it!
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
It's not even a fucking door.
I guess I lost:
All the time, sir.
I'd go with number three.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
What?  Who the hell are you?
Why?  What are you gonna do?
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
I taught kindergarten.
A what?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Get back in the car!
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
For how long?
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Why not?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Noon exactly.
I wanna make a deal.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What the hell is going on?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Where's he making his big speech?
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Can you see the balloon man?
Wait.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Why?
She's still alive?
Oh, Jesus...
What --
Because I found out about her...
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
That's comforting.
Yeah --
It's all I could safely move.
How do I find the --
I can't even stand up --
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
What?
I'm fine, Lamar.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
I'm not getting halo'd.
Everybody runs.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Everybody runs.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
Did Marks close the front door?!
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
You gonna tell on me?
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Do I know you?  Who are you?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Tell me how.
I guess that's all of it.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Kill me!
The what?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You say some of the children died?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
The female.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
You look great.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
He's my subordinate!
Where are you?
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Yes, I know.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Two?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I forgot my glasses.
To what?  Trap him?
But there's still the other two.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
What's 'incidentals?'
Is it a good room?
Yeah. Take it.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Manhattan.
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's alright.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
He's not doing it.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Ho's a good guy --
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Draw.
Yeah, sure.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Yeah?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Quick drop. In and out.
She was fast, huh?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
They were out of line --
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Then what are you saying?
No.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Good morning.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Soho.
Well, this is the corner.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Don't be shitty.
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. I know the number.
Shhh...
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
It's not even yours.
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Yeah, I guess.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
What are you doing?
I told you what they said.
They asked who it was.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
I mean, that's what I heard --
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
About what?
You too?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You got that right.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Where?
We're getting whacked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
You want us strapped, don't you?
What do you have left?
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Let's just go now and wait.
Easy...
I'll be a minute.
Bobby and Ricky.
Fuck...
I didn't do anything --
S'up.
The videos.
Where do you live?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
Word.
You'll love it.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
What?
Yes, sir.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
What?
That's none of your fucking business.
Bet you like that shit.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Solid, daddy.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What do you do with your time?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
No, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
I can handle it.
Yes.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Just hold me.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Dear heart, I love you.
I'm tired of praying.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
That's right.
Allah Akbar.
Sure, man.
I say a lot of things.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
The sentences to run concurrently.
Now you come back.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Murder.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
What does Sidney say?
What's your story, baby?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Tell him about Baldy.
So what about him?
That's right.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
So you are going to talk me to death.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
I'm not... easy.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
So what do I get in return?
I'll call you tomorrow.
[Si.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The what?]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
If they like me.
Who's Emilio?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
I'm not crying.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
I don't understand.
Yes.
That's not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Dyslexic?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
It's Creasy.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
[Yes.]
This is Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Hmm?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[Is that good or bad?]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
So am I.
I already ate.
That's what friends do.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Which one was that?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
What makes you say that?
Yeah, sure.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
What happen?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I don't.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Yes, I know.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Please...
Nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
No, I'm not kidding.
Where you going now?
I'll see you around.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Sure, what?
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
You gotta good heart.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
I heard you, Ma.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
She didn't look Italian to me.
What didn't you like about her?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
I don't wanna talk about it!
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Home.
Hospital.
He said it for us all, Walt.
There's only one way.
Or her figger.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
We're a good team.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
What?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
I like an olive.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
I don't get it.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
It's possible
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
Ayuh.
Of course not.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Homosexuality.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I don't think so either.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
Yes, sir?
I can try, sir.
Damn.
They can't do that to me!
Good morning.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Yeah, maybe.
Um-hum.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
So?
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Take it easy, John Doe.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
He's watching the other door.
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
What?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
You betcha.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Why—uh—
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Yeah.
Shh!
No, sir.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Yeah, okay.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Good. I don't want to be late.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
You can't help me, man.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Is that where you're family lives?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Automatic.
Is there a problem?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'll give you something.
Sorry... Habit.
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
You living together?
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
I'm not good at lying.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
We lost.
About six years. My partner took me.
Occasionally you lose.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
Greg.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
You let us worry about that.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Yes.

If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
No...
In a computer program.
Yes...

Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
It's his nature.
At least a day.
The weather.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
It's not used for anything.
Then where is she?
-- Katie.
No.
Her?
It was a test.
I know.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Checking connection.

You scare me, Charlie.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Could we step outside?
Can't we get a couple whores over?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Long as Charlie says.
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
London?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
What's your problem?
Come off it, Bugs.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Never threaten me, Boss.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
The kid just called me stupid.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Don, I'd be honored.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
What about the share.
I found that out.
I don't fuck my partners.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Spare us.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Just wanted ta say hello.
That a Jew compliment?
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Yeah...before your time.
Switch hands.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
<u>What</u> union?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Goodbye, sweetheart.

No!
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Yeah. What about the second act?
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
And to Don Quixote!
My friends?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Have *you*?
Well, let's get going.
Huh?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Why me?
He's a house-afire!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
No wonder--without your dinner.
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
How do you feel, champ?
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Aw--
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
What stuff?
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
We'd better see.
Office of--Senator Smith?
J-Jefferson Smith.
Did you say--bus?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Tonight.
Yes, I see that.
What's that?
We're over in the House.
Thanks very much.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Since sixteen or so.
I also answer to whistles.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
No!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Not another bill?
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Wonderful!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
How are the pigeons?
Then you *did* say it.
Goodnight, Senator--
And how's your bill, Senator?
Well--I--
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Yes, sir--
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Okay. See you here.
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
No?
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yes--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Do you?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Maybe he won't get up.
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Senator Paine.
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Some people like it.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
Yes, you own it.
Always.
He sure is.
No!
No! I resigned last week!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
I enjoy it.
What did they say?
It's wonderful.
That depends on what they see.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
What's that?
Nothing—
You have?
What did he play?
I'd like to read it some time.
I don't blame you.
No, I don't mind.
Oh, hello darling.
Don't be ridiculous.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Hello.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Hello . . .
Shhh!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Me sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
What was that you said he was?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
See you later, kid.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
No, thank you.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Nah.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Huh?
No, thanks.
Uh-huh.
Only common sense.
Entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Arthur wants to quit!
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Ja.
A child? My uncle's?
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
What's that?
Prairie? Oysters?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
I did what!
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Uh-huh. What are they?
You must have been concerned.
What's that?
No, not really.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Are we?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
What kind of doubts?
I don't want to hear any more today.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Go to hell.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
My pleasure.
I've had my moments.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
...And?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Don't need it.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
What do you mean?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Where?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Yes.
That's what I like.
Either one.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Um-huh.
Okay...
Anything... just ask.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
It's a big part of the show.
Where was this?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Do you think that's what he wants?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Don't you like this?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
This --
It's just a thought.
Jerking off?
You don't think I'm insane?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Just you.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
It wasn't the best situation.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
That'd be Lily.
No... no training.
You're completely reliable.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Really?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
None of the above, thank you.
Sounds familiar.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
What friend? You're my only friend.
You shall see.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
The things that get you excited.
How?
Not unless you call me Rick.
That bad huh?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Got what?
I have no choice.
I was mistaken.
That just makes you more gullible.
Oh.
Um, well, you see...
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
I know you knew I'd know.
Fantasizing... about you.
One last tweak.
When was that?
Atta, boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Hello?
Think positive.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Really?
Me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Curiosity.
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
It's home.
Monica!
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
With what?
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
So you're chicken?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Mother... it's not what you think!
I always knew that you were special.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman --
Or both.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But how do we get in?
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I think it's absolutely charming.
What do you have in mind?
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Fair enough.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Oh?
What is that?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Lisette.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
No...
Not even the slightest hint of something?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes.
Certainly.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
Yes.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
That is a matter of opinion.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
That's it?
Alright, I'll remember that.
Thanks, Unc.
Good.
Why you say that?
Cheeco.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Thanks for reminding me.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
You don't know Baby D.
You walked?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
I don't know yet.
I didn't see nothing.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Me too.
No, man, just wait.
What about me?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
What are you doing here?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I do.
I'll remember.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
What up, bro?
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
You could sell your Beamer.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
And some rolling papers.
Ya'll live around here?
Bite his ear!
I got fired too.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
What you doing to my nephew?
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
What's he doing here?
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Sorry.
I...
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
I'd like to know what...
Tell me why I miss him.
Tell me why he's dead.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
No, please...
No, that's,..that's fine
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
No way.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
All right.
I remember. The big tipper.
Oh, man...
What?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Yeah.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't know.
Thanks for the tip.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
I've done much better ones than this.
You're a big girl, huh?
Yeah.
Help me get her off the rug.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
'Daddy has to go now.
No.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
The money, Icey.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sshhh...
Hm?
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
She's gone to Moundsville.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Yonder.
Mm-hm.
What secret shall I tell?
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
I -- no, I --
Yes.
The Drugstore?
What?
No, nothing.
Get the kit!
Jesus.
Because he was scary, that's why.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
My dream.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What?
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
'Anything funny' like what?
How you know that?
It wasn't that serious...
Great
Right.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
You were screaming like crazy.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
Have you any money?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I have nothing to hide.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Evening gown?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Or it might be the firing squad!
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Which part of the room is mine?
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yes.
Count d'Algout...
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
I'll send you a muff.
Comrade.
Brave... that's right.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Yes, monsieur.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Even the swallows are back.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
You believe in our cause?
I think so too.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Yes.
He takes good care of that.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Ni-notchka.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
This is a place for workmen.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, I love you.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
No! No!
Much happier.
Let's turn on the radio.
But I can throw it out of the window.
...but big.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Yes, sweetheart. 
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
You can't imagine.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Is this your new dress suit?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Has done what?
Hello.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I must insist that you leave.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Yes, it does.
No.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
This will do. 
Where is that?
My jewels?!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
What?
I like that.  That's a solution.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
No, sir.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
... go on.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
How do you see this?
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
What's Liddy got?
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Silence!
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
All right.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
What?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Let him finish, Bob.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
What about the documents he promised?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
No ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
My friends call me "Mister President."
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
We'll see about that.
I beg your pardon --
Yeah ...
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Free, if you're the president.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
The hell with 'em.
Sir?
POWs.  And their families.
No, sir ...
Well, we could delete it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
I don't want them to love me.
Then I'll be there for you.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
They're all your enemies?
You personally?
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
They were for me.  They're mine.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
The "crises"?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
You ain't heard from him?
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
It could be.
Llewelyn Moss?
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Yes sir.
No sir.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
To your husband.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Hey.
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
You from around here?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
With what?
What time do you close?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
I could come back then.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
...Where you want me to put it?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
Okay.
Yessir. I understand that.
How well do you know Chigurh.
I know how he found me.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not any way.
To kill your wife.
No I don't have it.
I don't know.
No sir.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
Yes sir.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Anyway, so what?
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Oh. How come?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...I... I know what you are.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
...what're you saying?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Oh, Betty --
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
Didn't I?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
I'd slap his face.
What's his real name?
Like Rome?
He has no heartbeat!
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
You never know who you'll see.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Fine. You got five...
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Of what?
No...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I... I don't know...
Beer, please.
Hell of a way to die.
IT SURE IS!!
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Should I kill him now?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
...among others.
Worse... you're in Texas.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
A doctor on the show... why?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
We know that...
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Better.
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Okay, Everett.
Everett, my beard itches.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Problem a p'seption.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Helluva awgazation.
Not out the other side his face, though.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Blooey!
He's a suitor!
What for?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
I never said any of that!
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Come over here where I can see you.
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
It's important, sir!
Yes, sir!
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!!
I said, come here!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Everything was different.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
My kinda group!
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've never had a girl.
I'll get it if you want.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
What would you do differently?
Twenty-two years ago.
I know that.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Sure.
A little.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it can't wait.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
She didn't.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
I have the gun.
Remember that.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Keep your voice down.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
They're gonna die in there!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Everything okay?
I don't get it.
No ball, kid.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
It's just the woman and the kid?
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
The furniture guy?
0150.
Wait.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Chills?
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
Come on, come on...
I saw something, I saw...
He --
Huh uh.
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Fuck that, we've got company...
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
What's with you?
Yeah, it's me.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Jesus...
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
So talk...
Yeah... let me think about it.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Brimmer.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
And who is we?
Just a kid.
Maybe...
Just the legit shit.
If you got something to say, say it.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
No.
Late summer.
Uh... uh... I...
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
You couldn't have known.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Do you?
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Sir.
Are you going to meet with him?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
It's safer if we stay together.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
That's right.
Go on.
He left us.
I stand corrected.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
I'm sorry.
When?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
But what about Thomas?
For what?
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
When?
But father, they might come this way.
Bite?
Well...I guess not.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Yaay!
Yaay!
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yes.
I know.
Do you believe that?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Allman Brothers.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Then come on.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You keep saying that.
Yes.
What?
This babe has said enough.
It's Ellie's cat.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
I just said--
And Church will be fine.
Yes, I guess I do.
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
That's right.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Aye, for us there is.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Yes -- yes.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
-- then we never would have met.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Yes, the rum is gone.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
We're catching up!
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Indeed.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Somewhat.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Agreed!
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
This way!
I'll lead them away.
And no lies!
He's not telling the truth.
Where did he come from?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Until he's done.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Ain't it.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
The nanobot is gone.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Shut up and do it!
Thank you, sir.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
The big house?
I guess I should be flattered.
It already is.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
What happened to it?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
That was 'simple'?
That's right.
Blame the victim.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Yeah.  Old times.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
The head shrinker at the prison.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
Where is it?
Let's go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
The same thing I suppose.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
You were looking for us?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
And you have him?
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes - Sing Sing.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
For what?
How-di-do.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
What are you talking about?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
You're acting like a child.
Oh, hello Mother!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Is that so?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
No!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Quite so. Quite.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Well!
It's the smoke.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Nothing.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Yes - and I'd love it.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Very good.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
It's all right. Bring him in.
I have. Double-strength!
I beg your pardon?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
The name is Smythe.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Me, sir?
No, sir!
No, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
That's all I wanted to know!
Sure.
What?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
I think it looks nice.
Bud brought it to me.
I was in a bowling-alley.
No I'm not.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
... Lover's Lane.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Why not?
She won't go out with me?
I'm fine--but thank you.
No. What?
Thank you very much.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Still doesn't make it right.
The basketball team?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Yes.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
What's going to happen?
Just take deep breaths.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
What were you doing in a library?
He won't notice anyway.
It's okay.
Nothing.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
What?
Yeah.
Hunh?
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
That's right.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
... Hi.
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
No you're not.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
What?
Listen to me!
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Just listen to me ...
I brought you something ... From the library.
I'll never be able to do that.
No, that's not it.
Yeah ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
What happened?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
That's your fault not mine.
So it's ok if I bring her.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I have no idea.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I just want to know where she's staying.
This is Georgia.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
I'm in my bedroom.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Georgia.
Really? Please?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
....what....?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I have to go.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
No.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Really?
It's Barry.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah, no, I see --
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
This is Lena.
Yeah.
Ok.
Lena?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
This is nice.
I think maybe over a hundred.
You left me at the hospital.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Sorry.
That's fine.
Yes it is.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
-- and this is confidential?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I didn't know you had a sister?
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Like a psychiatrist?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
I'm sorry.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
You're goin' on a trip?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Ok.
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Please don't do this.
Is this where you live?
What time are you gonna be there?
Seriously.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
It's fine.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Ok.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
It's fine.
Should I call you later?
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
He's a writer, not a madman.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Enough to discern its tenor.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
His rug.
Valcour. His chair.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
An innocent child is dead.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I know, because I felt it myself --
AND DID YOU?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
That's not our intent --
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
And my own.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
Don't start --
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
There's something else I want from you.
I don't believe it!
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
What thought is that?
And I in yours.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
....shame on you, truly...
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Very much.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
I wonder sometimes.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
And he did.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
There's no call for that language-
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
One . . . buys things.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I am not that woman.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
There is nothing to discuss-
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
Not for me.
I don't want you to--
How so?
I can't remember the lines!
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
He personally asked you to?
Nonsense
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Please don't say this.
Orson. Stop. Just stop
So speaks the court jester.
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
She was . . . innocent
They don't have to.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
So they're Jews. . .
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
It's too late. The movie's made
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Thank you-
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
That's for me to decide.
Get out
Again.
Again
Ah, it's a grand title.
They've all seen a rough cut
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Then find another theater
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
It's just that my movie is so-
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
I really think you're
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Yes!
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You know, like bang her or anything?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
You want the title shot?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Yeah, I know.
Well, that's what I mean.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
So what?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
No.
That's all right. He don't mind.
Oh, Jake.
Who asked you?
Yeah, what?
I took the kids to my sister's.
What're you talking about?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
C'mon, Tommy --
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Right, the gym.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
But his leg!
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Who left -- where?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Your logic is backward.
That depends on who "they" were.
Like an old hambone?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
You did.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Gunnison?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Well, I only quote from the best.
It crashed, didn't it?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She pay you much?
How did you know!
Depends one which one.
Get back there! He'll see you!
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
Look!
I have a feeling we've just begun.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Not too active.
Uh-huh.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Tired?
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You mean "goodnight."
Tell me about it.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Now, Lisa --
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
What about it?
Someone not his wife?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
That's a suitcase?
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Thank you.
But you're not?
Good luck, Buzz.
I'm cute, too.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
That's funny!
Yes.
Shoot, Jimbo.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You don't?
Open it.
Well maybe she better start.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Head-shrinker?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I don't want to make friends.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Judy.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Plato!
Get away from me!
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Good Lord!
What's that got to do with it?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Leave me alone.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Yes, ma'am.
Listen--
Where what was.
Oh.
I'm not so bad.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
Neither can I.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
There's just one thing.  What about--
See, we're very modern.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Are you?
We have to go back!
Yes.  My best friend.
Okay.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
What?
My mother?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Gabriel!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
He'll be dead when he does.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
No, hey, I like your coat --
We could live it up and --
Nick, I love you --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
What?
Nick...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
The hell I can't.
I shared his cell!
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
Wish I had a brother like you.
What college.
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
Five million?
And I worked there. For a year.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
Might as well be.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Get out.
Nnn... nothing...
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Mr. Bangs.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Hi, Nick.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Merlin, I didn't know --
It's a roach, guy --
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I'm just saying.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
GUARD!!!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
...for Christmas...
She set them up. All of them.
Well...sorry...
Yes.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
You ain't dying, he is.
Who?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
What?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
What for?
You can do some crazy things with it.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
How many employees?
No, they're not.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Mr. Pink.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
You do?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
It's a surprise.
You didn't ask.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
No, I'm not!
I'm okay.
Lie back down, and try to -
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
That's not correct.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Where?
Where? Are they out in the car?
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I don't know anybody.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
There's a slight difference.
Maybe he did.
Nobody. The light was bad.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
And one of 'em is sick.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You can stay here if you like.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
He's learning his letters.
Hold on.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
It's too light yet.
I'm sorry.
It's going to Sonora.
To the other side of the street.
I haven't got the job yet.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
A little hot.
A man I used to know.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
Good thing you didn't.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
I won't again.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
I said I didn't care.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
I like it.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Yeah.
And we're running out of that.
What's the use.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
I don't care what he thinks.
Everybody knows --
Stop it --
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Yeah, we sure have.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
And you've got me all figured out?
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey, I have an idea...
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Okay.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Alright!
Huh?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Listen to me I --
I think so.
What, you think I did this to myself?
It's okay.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Yes!!!!
Just wait, you'll see.
My child, you're alive!
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I wouldn't go that far.
Saw who?!
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Are these all the subjects?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
That one.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Hi.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
How is she?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
What happened?
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Looks good, Mom!
You scared me.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
That's nice.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
What a mess.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
I beg your pardon?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Marvin A. Pickles.
Yes, I was.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
I'll try there.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
I guess most people are.
Thank you.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Weren't you afraid?
Thank you.. .goodnight.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
Why wait?
But you're always at the library.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
I have to go —-
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
What a peculiar question.
Uh—huh.
I'd like that.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
You know where she is?
I don't know.
It seems right to us.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Unless what?
I'm very, very serious.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Why?
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Please.
What did he say?
False alarm.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Nine years.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Sister older or younger?
No.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
All of these are interviews?
Can we look at one?
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Everything about sex.
Yes.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I know.
Yes.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
Don't you want to make one?
What do you have to do to get ready?
I have money.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Who was the last person you had sex with?
What was the problem?
And now you can?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
But I don't understand --
No.
I don't know. Possibly.
I don't know.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Why not?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
You did that?
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Are you having an affair?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Why don't I believe you?
I want out of this marriage.
Yes!
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Yeah, so?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
So it was recently that you tried this.
No, I haven't.
I guess.
Why?
Why?
Do you have to say that?
He doesn't have a phone.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Why did you do that?
Did he touch you?
What is it?
Hold on.
Thirty-two dollars.
There's a phone here.
Nope.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Not exactly.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
No.
Very much live.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Hi.
Okay.
Could be risky.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
What's so stupid about it?
Right.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
I just... Ann is very...
Did he put you up to this?
Will you lease month-to-month?
You have family here also?
No.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Yes?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Uh, OK. Sure.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
It's crazy.
That you, Rog?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Huh?
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
NIGHT NIGHT
Of course.
What?
You got it!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
He was a President.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
He was adopted you know.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
That doesn't make sense.
I'm sorry, Officer.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Me?
Do you really think so?
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL
SIN-I-FUL
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
We're not confused.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
You guys having fun?
Good. That's good.
Gary.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Highliner.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Oh yeah.
Good. How're you?
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Yeah, Conundrum.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Um... seventy... something.
Now we're talking.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
You know her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
And she likes Pinot.
Beautiful.
I'm a quick learner.
With Maya?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay! Fuck!
Bathroom.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Understanding of what?
Nope.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
No.
It's private.
I know what you need.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Huh. Let me think.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
What's that?
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You said it looked like a car accident.
I'll pay for it.
You need a new car anyway.
Why don't you come in?
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Sure.
Hey.
Yeah, I know.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
"The Day After Yesterday."
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Ken.
About four weeks.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
He had to make a phone call.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Only for pee or poop.
I'm here.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Curse and stuff.
You want him coming in the house next time?
I heard.
Yes, it was.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Ray Reddy's house.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Have they said anything about our area?
Don't do it.
Oh.
Who wrote this book?
That means they're unemployed.
What's two?
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
No.
Six months.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Don't worry.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
You're in here for winging a guy?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Your next water ain't for three days.
Yeah... that must have been it.
It's one thing to know it...
I already did that.
No, Leavenworth.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Going to Turley, was it?
It's a town...
Which way do you mean?
I understand.
No hard feelings.
I'll be around.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
He is now.
We'd rather stay.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
You like a good saloon?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
I'm glad we talked.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Even the fall from the plane.
I'll walk you out.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.
Excuse me?  Start?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Hello, is this Elaine?
It was a great show, Dad...
So you did meet her?
Well, I --
Yes, call me Simone.
Please put your clothes on
How about the nudity?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
And what may I ask brought this on?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Clyde.
It was more in passing.
Body double.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I need flesh and --
I don't know anything about computers.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Hello, Lainey.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
I know plenty of boys.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I noticed.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
She did... didn't she?
I know.  Thank her for me.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
What do you want -- ?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
I don't understand.
But that's Simone's part.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Dr. Crowe.
How do you draw now?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
He your best buddy?
You hate him?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Yes.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes, I am.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I definitely won't.
Maybe.
...I don't know.
Got it.
Like what?
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Who!
S-ssstop that!
It's our pleasure.
J. C. Penny's?
Alright!
Nope.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Bus broke down.
I could. You sucked.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
People say he was a murderer.
Not while you're driving.
What's wrong?
He's right. You were behind.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Let it go.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Don't look.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
What'll we do?
Bill, we need to talk!
Oh, yeah?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
I'm sorry.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
What?
Brought you munchies.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Okay.
Grant, no!
What other stuff?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You know how rumors start.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Okay.
Having fun.
Would I lie to you?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
You could've asked.
Yeah?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Yes.
I'll do it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
They're jammed!
Forty-two minutes ahead.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
What's your twenty?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Then don't.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
You okay?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm here.
What's that, pardner?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
Of course. Yes.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Yeah.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Uh, yeah.
Ww... uh...
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
I got his machine.
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
A million flat.
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
What!?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Security's locking down the elevators.
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
My wife.
I don't know.
No.
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
Let's go home.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I think so.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
It's all right.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Rheya --
Then you won't make it.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I can't --
You must have been dreaming.
Why do you say that?
We want to talk freely.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Listen, that was my fault.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
No kidding.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
I'll miss you, Mike...
Sleep good.
Not exactly.
Oh God, that's great!
Long enough.
Mike...?
Listen, I'll... see you again.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
Sure we are, let's go!
Absolutely.
I'm all right.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Your what...?
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Why?
I might stop you.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
What're you talking about --
I'm sorry.
I watched TV.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What's the difference?
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call a cruiser!
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Ever shot anyone?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Is she injured?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
I know where everything is.
Okay, I guess.
She's taking singing lessons.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Remember Little League?
I know.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
They'll never take me alive.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Right.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
But you like that in a man?
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Nah.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
I know him.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
See?  You big dullard.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Like it?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Phooey on that.
I'm not so happy myself.
No, no!  Not there!
Is you all good Nazis?
Roger.
Yeah. Security.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
That's right.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Why not?
We're looking at it.
Which one of you is what?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Twenty-five.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
It's a mouse trap.
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Let me go!
What's the award?
Me? What if she don't want me?
Where'd that come from?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
So what? There's other women!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
What do they always say?
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
It's that song, Harry!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Are we boring you?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
What about the radio?
Are you questioning me?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Not particularly.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
A chicken?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
HoS qorDu. 
He is.
Twelve years, sir.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Can you project its course?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Agreed.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
No, no. Thank you.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I hadn't planned on it.
And what would that be, sir?
A photon torpedo?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Make it so.
Understood. That will be all.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Aye, sir.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
What did you see, Chekov?
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
On screen.
What is it?
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
I'll handle that later.
I have already made one transmission too many...
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Much is at stake...
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I'll need it, Sulu.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
About a dozen officers and men.
Come on!
Go, Sulu!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Any time.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
... The needs of the few...
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Exactly. Happy birthday.
And who am I hiding from?
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Is that a poem?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
I know, I know...
But we can't just sit here -- !
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
Only half of you would get there.
I don't know.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir --
A few shots, sir.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Try the emergency channels...
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Aye, sir.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Best speed, Scotty...
Or the one.
Spock...!
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Take the test again.
Who?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
Understood, sir.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Engage warp engines --
Try again.
Battle stations.
By the book...
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
-- That's the general idea.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
... My shoes...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
That is what I said, Doctor.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
I'm wery sorry, but --
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Hm?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Noon tomorrow...?!
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
You need me.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Explain.
Ah... The giants.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Thank you, Spock.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Weapons systems?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Picture, Uhura!
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Mr. Sulu?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
... Yes?
Sulu Hikaru.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
I'll be here.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Sometimes I do.
No.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Another time.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Understood.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Do you have everything you need from command?
Fail-safe?
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Why was Data assigned?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
... I believe you...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Yes...
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Bag him.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
I do not know what you are referring to.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Understood. Keep me informed.
I have the password right here.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
We're crossing the threshold!
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
There's a few of us left.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I can try.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
I have to...
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Steady as she goes.
Onscreen.
Worf... torpedo... now!
We're still in Earth orbit.
Unless you'd like to stay.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
Nothing.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Commander... we have a problem.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
You may need assistance, doctor...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Come on...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Stand...?
Very much.
Uhura, monitor!
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Onscreen.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
We must do this again soon.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
There's a reward for your death.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Where do we come in?
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Spock, you want to know something?
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Such things have happened before, sir.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
You having hearing problems, mister?
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
I know precisely where he'll be.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
I believe I am.
Aye, aye, sir.
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
No. Can I move now?
You're working late.
Is he very much like you were?
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
On my way.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
Negative.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Why is it moving?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
Do you have a moment, sir?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How could I not?
I know how he thinks.
No!
This isn't real.
You sick bastard!
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Do you have life support?
Understood.
What do we know about the planet?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Aye, sir.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Who was it?
Still well on our side...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Counselor?
We can only hope so.
Praetor Shinzon?
I've never met a human woman.
And the Senate supports you?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
But you want to.
I am.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Should I raise shields?
Yes, Praetor.
Find her again.
None.
Praetor.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
It is beautiful.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Shermin...
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Okay...
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Which way do you want to go?
What.
X...
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
Gas good?
I am Jenny Haydn.
I am...
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
You better.
No.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
But I speak English.
Go?
What?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Are you my friend?
That was beautiful.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You're damn right I am.
But...
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
What? No, of course not.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
It was a man though... right?
No.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
You saw that?
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Yeah, right.
No problem.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
My God.
Forget it's there.
No, Lenny.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Shutup a second!
Yeah.  No, not really.
He records himself raping and killing her--
W'sup, Max?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What?
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Define illegal.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Let's talk in the car.
Get it.
She still loves me.
You'll see.
No idea.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
So that gives you something.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
It's not your fault.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
Sure.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Well, look at the plus side.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Just Lenny.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Aw, Mom!
You really want that on your head?
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
You're thinking...?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Yes.
What about his killer?
Just an observer.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Who?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
How long ago?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Huh?, sir.
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
They're all criminals?
We did find these, however.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
What's up?
Does one exist?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
I...
Kulok.
Sit back.
I'll be back.
The little piggie speaks.
Yes, sir.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He's moved on to TV.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
It was the mall.
You? You went by the book?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
I screwed up twice, sir.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I know, I know.
I don't know about that.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
You're money, baby.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
How was it hard?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
My pleasure.
No.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
I'm a comedian.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Oh... right.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
I can call back...
Why didn't you call?
I heard you might be moving back...
You don't call.
It sucks.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Kinda.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Oh boy.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
When?
What?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
What?!?
Yea, how much?
What an asshole.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
...gotta...
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
No! Not the camera guy!
Hold on.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah. You met him once.
...through the kitchen...
It's on.
What?
What a surprise.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Oh. He's got it under control...
...Is he brown?
True.
Now go over there and get those digits.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...just be smart about it.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
I ask for Justice.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
You have to answer for Santino.
Like hell I will.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Are you worried about security for your million?
Sure.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
For killing a man.
No.
How did you find out?
You want him to stay in this country.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Shhhhh.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Mike!
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
And when they shot me father...
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Thanks Tom.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Did he give you his politicians?
And what do you want for Christmas?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
No.
I'm thinking about it.
I love you.
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Cut it out.
The kid's right.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Yes, I promise.
Be patient.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Is that good?
It's vile.
Okay, darling.
No, I like him.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
What? What's this?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
Your parents met her.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
What?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
What club?
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Sure.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Have you done something to your hair?
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
I just don't believe that!
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Frances?
What about Cortina?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Dickie did it.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
Why? When?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Do you know Tom?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I'm fine.
It's okay.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Postmortem?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Yes, mam.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
What?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I'm leaving.
Sure.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
More people watch it.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
You said that?
A real skunk.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
In the jungle. 122nd.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
I don't like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
You can do it in my mouth.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Huh?
He shoots dope too.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Cops don't do nothin.
My work may take me out of New York.
Age?
You would, huh?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Your name Sport?
Funny, you don't look hip. 
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Thanks.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Wrong.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
It's about time.
The cell, Mason.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Whatever happens.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
I wish you were coming with me.
Delly?  In here.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
And why not?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Nothing.  
What?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Thanks.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Yes.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
I... I need a drink of water.
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
By all means.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
When did I leave?
Can't wait.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
The film broke...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
The G-man?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
No, sir.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
I... I don't believe this.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Cat.
Oh.
I thought you...
You bet, honey.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Yes.
Lovebirds.
Yes, I did.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
How'd you happen to come here?
I suspected as much.
A trifle.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Cathy!
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Yep.
That's where the Brenners live.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Okay.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
It's nothing.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes.
I know, Mother.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Oh, my God, look at her!
Oh, thank you.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
And if you don't?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Would you like me to go for her?
Did you close the door?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
We know what it is, Al.
Not by the thousands.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
How can you tell?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Yes?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
He was watching a ball game on television.
Oh, yes.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.
I wrote the letter.
It is for me.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Hear!
Take wing!
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Maybe.
Almost two a.m.
No... wait.  Hold me.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
And he'll talk?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
How soon?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
To...  To kill them.
With smoke.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Ask this one favor --
Yes.
It is a pity.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Aye.
MacFarlane
I've heard of it.
Come in, boy -- come in.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
I remember her.
I can't believe that.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
No.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Not yet.
He was a nice horse.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I want it --
I wanted to see the white horse --
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
You will not have it?
Afraid of what?
I am the best man for the job.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I've ordered nothing from you.
We have never been friends.
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Nearly a year.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
You can get out.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
Dream on.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Yeah. I sure will.
I don't know you, man.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I was talking about you.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
My father.
Yeah, we do.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
Would you care to be more specific?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Okay.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why not, Bobby?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Just Klaatu.
About 250 million of your miles.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
You still haven't answered my question.
Is it real?
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I feel different right now.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I see you for a minute?
Yes--?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Where is the meeting going to be?
I -- I thought you were--
He'll have you -- and Tom.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I'd give you a very good price.
How long will that take?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
You better get some fresh air.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Yeah.
He's my brother.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
I can't do that!
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Whatcha doin' over here?
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Michael!...
I thought we were poor.
Soon.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
In here?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Well, I...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
What do you mean?
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
No... no, everything's different now...
Because I love you...
Save Laddie first.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  Why?
Don't bother.
Piss off.
The Marines.
Huh?...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Maybe.
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Cool it, Palmer!!
Don't walk behind me.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Look, I'm just guessing...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
What?
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
What do you mean "you think so?"
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Thank you.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
How far's that?
You reach anybody yet?
Damn if I won't.
Little over two hours.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Then we go after him.
MacReady, that you?
Where?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What kind of stories?
No...
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Can you show us where they live?
Yes.
It was meant to.
Yes.
This is the way in?
No...
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I'll never forget this.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
No...
I just love mechanical things.
What's happening to the moon?!
Got here as soon as I could.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Holding you... again.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
Let them.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Perseverance.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
His home.
Thank you...
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
We share everything.
What's it all for?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
What are you?
How do you decide?
Did you have fires at night?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
It's undamaged?
Go back to your own time?
Mara...?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
I did...
What are your people called?
New Yorkers.
No...
New Yorkers.
We choose to believe it.
I am.  Are you a climber?
For our sake, I hope not.
Then don't.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
In where?
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
He didn't either.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
They should just be looking harder.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Why?
You two ok?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Yeah.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I know.
They're not.
Ok.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I guess I'd ask you why.
I never knew my father. Did you?
[Beat] I don't know.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Because I don't have time.
I did?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
What are you talking about?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Why?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
No.
Sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Yup. That's me.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Uh-huh.
What?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You want to come on in?
Oh, great.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
What for?
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Not yet.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Why now, Jimmy?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Ready when you are.
Which part?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Why are you actin' like this?
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Try to.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
You're right.
Now what what?
Yeah.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Shoot the radio!
Hit it.
Yes.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What do you mean?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
He implied it.
Good-looking?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Well... at least now you know.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Am I?
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
I beg your pardon?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
-- He's in a cage?!
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
That...? Vestibule.
You're a movie buff?
A fucking moron.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Well, I'll see ya.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
No, not at all.
So she's married?
Surprised?
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Kim and I are close friends!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Nice.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
I never said that.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
He's no Steve Young.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Where would I have seen your work?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Oh yeah.
You betcha!
Really? I never got a message.
He's dead.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
What are you?
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Yeah?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Mary, come on...
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
What do you mean?
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Huh...?
What --
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
What if I can't?
We've got bigger problems right now.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Something your father would've come up with.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Then they should speak up.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
An invasion...
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
He was.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Dean Rusk!
I, uh...
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Good.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
That may be what they want us to think.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Rug samples.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
What journey?
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Seven.
Jesus...
Good.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
She's that subtle?
Yes.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
What you call myths, we call our history.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
What do you mean?
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
You didn't have another vision...
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Go ahead, Ray.
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
I could be, too.
You know. The finger.
I'm special.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
The what?
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
What plane.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Are you really that brave?
Where?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
You always get what you want?
Anything.
I'm still second best.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Not to me.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What?
I sit. I think. I play games.
I like to play "reality".
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
How does it go?
Who's gonna win?
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
How could you?
...Something like that.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
What is?
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Okay.
But I have to!
On what?
So's my Johnson.
Who's your pilot?
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Time to go.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Don't.
Was.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
What now?
GOT 'EM.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
Nope.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
What the hell you doing?
Didn't everybody?
Yes sir!
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
No bother.
I don't know...
He was by the book, all the way.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
But maybe you can change all that.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
How'd you find me?
Get it, please.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Yes, sir.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Eight years.
Brunette.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
O.K., everybody pull out!
Rekall?
Harry!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
You know I do.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Just think about it.
Bye.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
I'm not your wife.
Implanted.
Beats me.  I just work here.
Nice to meet you.
That a problem?
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
There's something I have to tell you...
Hauser left me a note.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Oh, since when?
The reactor.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Cannon fuse.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Well, who put you two in charge?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Well, sure.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Val!  Val!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Little sons of bitches.
Me, too.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
You bet.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
It's...gone...!
Okay, ten dollars.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
He was your snitch.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Correct.
I have to talk to your brother.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Not necessarily...
I can describe it.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Of course.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
-- You found his mugshot?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
...What do you mean?
But what?
I'm not that desperate.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
I've seen this picture before.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
-- Me? Neither.
You're doing a murder case?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
You don't drink "booze".
EXACTLY!
That's right.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Badgering.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
No? Then what did he say?
-- What trial?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Blonde.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Get lost Bobby.
You killed Mike.
What was?
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Thank you, Carl.
An old woman and her grandson.
Yep, it sure is.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Anything else?
Tell me about the letter.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Any friends?
How do you figure?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Cole said she was 17.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I'll get my kit.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
I don't know what to do.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
But Bob isn't real.
Maybe.
No... No...
Hey, Jacques...
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
James...
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
Mom, take it easy.
Fine.
A friend from school.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Nothing, I chickened out.
How did you settle on the amount?
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
What does it mean?
I...
You've just said you signed it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
I'm just an M.D.
I am seventy-four years old.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Huh!
That's right.
That's what I'd planned to...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Yes? Galvin, right?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
...that's perfectly all right.
Yes.
Yes...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
What?
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Yes. It was, actually.
Maybe what?
What...?
Isn't there something you...
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
It's over!
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Let me talk to Mickey.
From the magazine?
Missus...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Yes.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
What do you want?
What?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
I can't talk now.
I'm swell.
You use their witness.
Read me what she said.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
We got to talk.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes, the roving nurse...
As I've said we had some more...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Right.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
D.O. to number three..come in.
Sort of a trial balloon.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase. Hi...
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Oh my God...
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
He was just here!
Everything is not fine!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
Say how they find their way back home.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Home, that's right.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Read me some?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Steady...
Yes?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Listen, dammit.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
What's that?
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
It can be captured, sometimes.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Not yet.
Your father?
You miss him.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Yes, Sir.
I didn't know sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Whatever.
What?
Congratulations.
I know.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
What?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Shut up, Phil.
What's the difference?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
No, I didn't.
Fine.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
All stop on the engine.
Face what?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Twice.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
What's that?
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
What?
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Joy, rapture...
What?
I'm sorry...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
What's that supposed to mean?!
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Yessir.
Well... Yeah - okay.
Get out.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Sorry to hear it.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Forty bucks...
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Thanks.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Whattaya do there?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
In many capacities.
I couldn't say, which one?
Why not? How was the fishin'?
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
What I made you do, mama?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
She got me an abortion...
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
I'm goin'.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Yeah.
Under a hundred.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
That'd be good, Lula.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
What if I asked you not to?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos...
In the head.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
What?
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
No...
No.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
He's right, you look horrible.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He heard everything we were saying.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Ye-es?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
That was MacCaulay.
Excuse me?
You did.
How long have you been having them?
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Yea?
...You carry firearms.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Heaven?
I'll miss my bus.
That's really it.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
She is. Ah. Here we go...
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Sure.
What'd you tell him?
Well done, James.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Hm.
Your aunt?
Glaucoma?
Where's that?
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Kinship.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Because of my coat?
I didn't mean it that way.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
I eat.
Okay.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Who does?
Chancellor.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
I think I might have.
I said it didn't sound like you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
And you're old.
I know, but sometimes...
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
What's that?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I... I...
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
As a heart attack.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
That's weird.
I might have his number on campus.
Just a few then. The big ones.
You want to keep him happy.
Beautiful. How's business?
Something wrong with that?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
It's a nice table.
It was a beautiful present.
It wasn't like that.
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
What's that?
Isn't it?
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
I fell asleep.
Woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
No.
I went to bed around seven.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
Why's that?
Lovers' quarrel?
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
I don't mind.
A diary?
You think reflection is good.
How's that?
It's okay.
Honest? No.
I don't need someone else.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I'm afraid not.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
What is your idea of being normal?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
We're little kids.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
All right.
This is garbage!
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes.
It was a small house.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Accept you?
Me?
Neither do you.
Sorry.
What about them?
What?
Not tonight.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
What did you do to them?
How young?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I was always the one seduced.
Nothing. It's over.
What?
No you don't.
What?
What's it look like?
You're such an asshole.
I'm not scared.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Hey, you okay?
I'm switching off now.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Who then?
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Let's go, guys.
No.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.
Yuh?
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
You already know what they are.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
No.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Nothing.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
To the shark.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
We'll try again.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Ask her.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Is that far from here?
You really must do me this one favor.
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
Through someone else?
Who?
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Why?
No.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
No I don't.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Oh, yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
And what happened?
Would you like to ask them?
No.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Yes.
Because I don't want one.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Everything... I don't have children.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
I breathed!
Yes.
She can.
Her headaches.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
As much as Mother Miriam does?
To help me.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Yes.
What do you think it's there for?
What do you feel?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Frightened.
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Who?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
What about Roger? He's free.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Uh huh.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Obviously there was.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
I am not with the Inquisition.
What's your opinion?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
And what happened?
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Aquittal.
Oh, some time in January.
Earthquakes?
Nothing.
Was the child full term?
Yes.
I'd like yours too.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Nothing...
Long, thin and filtered.
Hand rolled.
Saint Peter?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Begin what?
Would it stop you if I did?
You're what?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
The scandal...
That's a lie.
Then she's a liar.
We'd be thrown out.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah?
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Read 'em!
Spoil sport!
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Bag-snatcher.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
He's sulking again.
We do.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
I'll look in here again.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Something like that.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Oh ... I dunno.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Have they?
Nothing good.
What's he on about?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
But I'm clean.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
We were going to do it.
Come on speedy!
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
You wouldn't!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
What have you heard?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Don't exaggerate.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Aren't we ...
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Nerves.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Is that you, Roby?
Hell, we're equipped --
Yeah.  Two hours.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Is it solid?
Receiving.
Looks like a derelict.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
You want to try?
No, I want to go in.
Take care.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
God I'm hungry.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Dead.
The water will still recycle.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
I hope not.
Poison gas...
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Sounds like a rough one.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
We can use the flamethrower.
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Look --
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Found what?
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Food-storage room!
Right now let's keep it closed.
By eating our food supplies.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Can we get to him?
I'll get you out of there.
Yeah...
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Thanks.
Oh man...
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Okay, give me the numbers.
What's happening?
Too many.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
And?
Get her on-line.  Now!
No, but I got something that might interest you.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Nooooo!
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What?
What?
What's the problem?
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Agreed.
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Yes. I do.
D-day.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Why not?
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Frankly, I don't remember.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Thank you so much.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
And cut that out right now.
Call me when you get in...
When - when are you coming back?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Sing it?
I get a party, don't I?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
See you...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Don't calm down.
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I've been aware of that for some time.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
You know what I'm going to be?
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
I just wondered.
Why you have to go out there.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Is that what you want me to be?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
What did you expect - live sables?
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
Of course!
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Hmm?
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I - I guess I fell asleep.
You were just looking around...
You rest. I'll get it...
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Of course.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I'll never get over it.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Thank you, Karen.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
I had no idea you knew each other.
Why not?
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
You've what?
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
What about Bill?
Well...
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just can't believe it.
You'll be there, won't you.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Where'd you get all that information?
I wonder why.
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Such as?
Margo!
That was way back...
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
What is he talking about?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
I will.
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
What do you mean?
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Too bad.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
But that was the fourth straight time.
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
A couple of weeks.
But what could she do?
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
We need a sympathetic face.
The fucking New York Times.
--you do?--with access to records?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
You voted for him.
--we will--
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--has he got an ax?--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
Maybe we are...
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Night.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
--Teddy Kennedy?
--Deep Throat?--
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Give me your checkbook then.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
I don't know what they'd do to me.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
To cover up?
I will not talk about the other two.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
How senior?
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Electronic surveillance.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
...you're definitely doing a story...?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Mitchell knew then.
Haldeman too?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--I'm Woodward.
I think so.
No.
It may never come out.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Nobody ever had too much.
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
Could develop.
--go over your sources again--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
Haldeman.  Right?
Sorry, coach.
Suck me...beautiful?
...okay...
Neither did I!
Seduce her.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Forget it.
Neither will I.
I'm glad you think so.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
You can't sing at the competition.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
What?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
I do, baby, I do.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Pontificated.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Just in time.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
He's going in!
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Yeah.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Okay!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
You've got something going?
I thought so.
Me?
For me?
God dammit, Stifler!
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
I think "shithead" really says it.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
No...I know the perfect time...
Me too.
Okay.
Yeah.
Qualify for what?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I don't care.
I think we're falling in love.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Yep.
Thanks.
Just like sex with my wife.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
I'll be right back. Stay put.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
What?
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Looks like he lied to you too.
Oh shit... No...
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Andy? Andy is that you?
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
You fucking liar!
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I know, but I had to because . . .
When you're older . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Trying... to... breathe...
You are the Princess.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
I cursed then all!
You'd lose your security deposit?
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Shut up!
Ah! Let us begin!
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Come on.
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Yeah? Allison what?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
How can you possibly oversleep?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
M'm.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Hey, that was last year.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Well, where is it? I-
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Okay.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
M'hm...
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
It's terrific.
Okay.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Oh.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
H'm?
Yeah?
U-huh.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Following is different. I was spying.
David? You call your teacher David?
Yeah?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oh.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
No.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
It's for my complexion.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What... huh?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Nothing at all?
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Step up here!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Commentary.
I have a headache.
You have a raccoon?
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
What are you depressed about?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Look, uh...
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V.P.L.?
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And... uh-
We're gonna operate together.
His wife has diabetes!
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
We really had a good time.
No.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
Very well.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
Why last?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
What?
I...wait, what are you talking about?
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Borrow whatever you like.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Sally?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
When does he graduate high school?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
Give him a minute, Clair.
Probably not.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Really?
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
He'll find his way back.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!!!!
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Ah...
Oh, you know, I am.
Sure.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Oh.  You're serious.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I'll be your best friend.
I will treasure this.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Lemon.
And he doesn't smoke?
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Not good.
I'm sure you understand.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Excuse me?
Let's just go home, okay?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
How long ago was it?
No, never.
Thank you.
Really??
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Like your business managers?
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And the food sucks, I know.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Not nice.  Not kind.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Invisible!
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
I'm Princess Bala.
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...no, but --
Yes?
Oh no...
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
You did?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Barbatus?
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Oh, of course --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
...Ants...
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Something the matter?
Why?
Really?
Good night.
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Two o'clock.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Pick a card.
A cemetery?
Gin.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Sure.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
For me?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
In the knee?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
The dishes?
I don't?
Fine. How's your eye?
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
What kind of joint are you running?
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Relax, Baxter.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
I know how it is.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Yes, sir.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
How's that again?
Thank you, sir.
You?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Aren't you?
Sure, Doc.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No.
No.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Let me take that.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
We talked about a lot of things.
I wasn't trying.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Handle what?
I love you -- remember?
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Atlantic City?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Go where?
It won't happen again.
It's a thought.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Dreadful.
I like all of them --
My men --
Esprit de corps --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Sure, thanks.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
No.
Fat. That's real fat.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
God knows.
Not a thing.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
I'll go with him --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Yeah, it still runs.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
A lame ?
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
Your daughter.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Sure -- fine --
What?
Boss left.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
No. Walked.
Who knows.
Hairy ?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You know you're right.
You can't have water after morphine.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Fuck no.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Yeah... thanks.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
No -- leave it --
That's me.
So Kurtz is alive.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
No. Not really.
I know.
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Right now -- I am.
I do.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Son of a bitch, sir.
89   CONTINUED:
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
157  CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
-- Corbett's a killer.
Why?
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
It's exactly what you meant.
-- Permanently?
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Wait a second.
I'm staying.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
A daughter in Oregon.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
Forget it.  It would take days.
How many do you see?
You got one?
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Nothing personal.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
What does this matter to you?
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
What are you doing here?
How ya doing?
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Thank you.
Two days.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Welcome.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Can we order first?
Fries.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
It's one idea...
I can trust my brain.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Yes. I really would.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
All right, cut me a break.
What are you trying to do to me?
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Do it.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
About a dog.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Well, I can't reach them.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What's he look like?
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Thank you for walking him.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
I forgot to lock the door.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
No fucking way.
What?  What's okay?
I ain't scared of you.
What?
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
The contract was stolen.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Robert?  Robert?
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Where are we going?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Until a minute ago.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Yes.
He was killed.
Where you wanted to be?
You went from high school to the Agency?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
Yes.
Are they usually like that?
After that?
Did it ever bother you?
Several.
Nothing.
What?
No.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Fine.
Okay.  Then what?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
That means you won't have a gun.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Why?
It can be.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Martin.
Honesty.
Everyone regrets something.
It's a common question.
Average.
Taken.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
You mean quit?
I have all day.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
A coke, if they have it?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
What's that? Free!
What did the beer cost?
An alternative literary venue!
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
It's big, right Jahn?
We could make a run for it?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
So?
'cause you stink of booze.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No....The Asylum!
Can you do the lock on it?
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Have you ever stolen anything?
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
We don't speak Czech!
When your ready Son!
You capitalist pig!
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Some deal you did there!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
That one?
That's my mum's.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Sure. Excellent.
Really?
Yeah, maybe.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
But I love you!
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
It's not so much.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yo, dobree!
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
No, just a coffee.
Uh-huh!
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Cool!
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
That's right.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Yeah!
Working....Under cover.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
You bastard!
Can we talk in your office?
Heart be still.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Late night.  You?
Yeah.
I meant he's a doctor.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
Demented.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Me.
'They won't.'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
Kinda. Yeah.
Go for it.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Don't bother!
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
My relationship with God is my own.
Don't you?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
Yeah --
And that would ruin your reputation how?
You don't know what you want --
And why would that scare me?
Not possible.
Me.
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
That's what I mean.
Tired.
Better. I was really angry.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
No. I want what's best for you.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Yes. You?
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get -- ?
You came here to give me my report card?
Yeah.
A similar triangle?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
But he didn't ask me.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
What drill?
Learn anything?
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Well... yeah...
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
What's this all about?
Pro! Release the rope!
AM or PM?
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Why?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Professor, be serious, would you?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Jesus!
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
I run this place! 
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Hi, Marty!
Well, he's gone.
Not bad.
Okay.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Yeah.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
What'd you come out here for?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
Yeah? Why not?
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
I know.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
He was nervous.
I don't know.
I don't want a steak.
Positive?
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I just don't want to go.
Really?
Yes?
Just thinking.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
It's mine all right.
Beats me.
Who're you?
They're stealing my chopper!
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
It?  Who does?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Everybody okay up here?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
She was killed, Penny.
A what?
John Whorfin will kill us!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
...I know this must look... funny.
Hello.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
You wrote his scripts for him?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Stop it, Bill!
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well... actually, no Bill...
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I need help, Audrey.
Ever act?
Who?
Well I...
To do what?
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
That's all right, really –
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
What do you mean?
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
I'm at the Earle.
Lou.
...Both maybe?
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
What –
Uh-huh.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
...Fred...
Mr. Lipnik, please –
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
Did you find out about her parents?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I know who you are.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Are you arresting me?
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.
That's right.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Didn't you study it in school?
No.
Don't get too cocky.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
She's seen everything before.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Fine.  How's your back?
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I know.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Of course I knew.
I found Lisa Henderson.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Cocaine.
Nilsen?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
What is it you got between you?
I know what that's like.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
What was it?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Fuck you, too Nick.
She killed him.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Can you check again?
No. Should I have?
I don't know.
Not sure. How was yours?
What about the shit they write?
I think it's in New Jersey.
Oh, I didn't know that.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Do you still love her?
You want a drink?
I know.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I need a dealer.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
What?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Out?
Yeah..
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
What's wrong with you today?
About what?
Oh – you mean black people!
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I guess you did.
Can I walk you home?
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
What who's saying?
It's Monday morning.
Well thanks!
I hadn't thought about it.
That's great.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
I didn't know.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Treat to be here.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Weird, huh?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
It does to me.
One way to find out?
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Right here, sir.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
You'd be surprised.
I'm afraid to ask.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Mr. Freeze.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Surf's up.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
Definitely.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wish I knew.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Our work?
I think they're getting worse.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Why, indeed?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How ya doin', Al?
And you are?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Slanta.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
That's usually my line.
Excuse me.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
I don't want to remember!
You do know. Try.
Excuse me.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
What I do isn't about revenge.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
Yesssssss. I know!
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
I got family. ...Please.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Never heard of a double-cross?
Let's see if you bleed green.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
You're a genius.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
... Where are you taking me?
I loathe bats.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
... Looks like a convention.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
No one would miss me.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
You okay?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Did you really ask?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Hi.....  Roses.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Thanks, Annie.
Night.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Excuse me.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
She's ... well, she's good.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
A car sounds sensible.
Sean Connery.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Great, good.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Of course he is.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Where did these guys come from?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh, ten uh...
How's your arm?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
That's my girl!
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
That's all we need.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
We're ghosts.
Is this like a trick question?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
We need help.  We deserve help.
About what?
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Are you a spirit too?
I want to get in.
I think so.
Yeah.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?

I'm beeyoo-teeful.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
... sheets.
Otho, can you do it?
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
It wasn't a joke.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Attic space.
Look at the tiny figures.
The attic.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
No.
No, Robert.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Oh? Certainly...
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
No. I like it here.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Yes. I was.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Our greenhouse.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Hello, Sid.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
... I see.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes. That is correct.
No, Ben.
I want to tell Eve.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. I like to watch.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Is his back feeling better?
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
I see...
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
But you won't sign, correct?
Try again.
I said - try again.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Good evening, Wilson.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Look, Johanna...
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Yes, sir.
Good. Anything else?
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Malkovich!
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
What?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
What?
You bastard.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Holy shit, yes!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
You're insane.
I wouldn't know.
No, really.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Maxine.
Just.
The usual, Barry.
My tits?
You're a fag or a liar.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Says who?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
You bastard!
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I have to see you.
Did you see the reviews?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
No.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You mean with Malkovich?
He's a selfish bastard.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes sir
Oh.
Yes ma'am.
In case of what?
Well, what can you do?
Extra?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
No, let her rest.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning, ma'am.
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
You sure?
He's sleeping in the church.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
I don't believe that. I won't.
What yard? When who-
All he can. All he can.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Oh, nothin', you know.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Walter, how--
Thank you, Donny.
Huh?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
He's handicapped, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And the, uh, the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Thank you.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
The main guy, Dieter--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Uh-huh.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
But he's--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Okay. That, uh.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Huh?
It's your roll--
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
The nail polish, Walter.
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
But Walter--
What about the toe?
Now Dude--
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
No, I'm--
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
Dude?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Hey, cool it Walter.
Come on, Walter!.
Wha.
You're a fuck, Walter!
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
He's half yours, partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Survival.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
The House of Pain.
Minutes.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Fry 'em.
For what?
Why?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Sounds like a plan.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Blood...
Too bad you're out of it.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Us?  What are you talking about?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Look, what's your problem?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
I don't buy it.
You're wrong.
Pass.
I'm sorry, I --
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Preventive medicine.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
What do you see here?
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Cancer.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Some. It's been slow --
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
I'm not leaving without you.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
Sometimes --
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
You.
Get away from him!
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
You've been listening in the whole time?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
I'll take my chances.
--which she may have--
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Trying to find the energy.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
So whoever built this--
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--Cotter's--
Whatever you want.
I know, I know.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
No.
What're you, nuts?
Too busy eating us?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Don't have one.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--I don't know.
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
For "James?"
No one ever comes here.
Anna's the witch.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--oh, Jesus--
One of the printers.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Ancient runes--
Ah, Domini?
And what's your excuse for being here?
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Yeah.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Does she, goddamnit??
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--it's urgent!
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Yes.
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
See a guy.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Huh?
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Thanks.
I don't know. I better get off now.
Abby--
You're bad.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right...
Remy.
Going out with Meurice.
What?
...Hell.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
No. It just made them feel better.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Ya catch any fish?
So it would seem.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
What.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
I'm not sick.
I've seen a few.
The criminals are winning.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
No. not at all.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
If you want to.
Oh he forced you, huh?
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Then you got undressed.
It's okay. It's okay.
No. please. I won't.
Then don't talk about killing.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
What do you want?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
They hurt his head.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
No thanks. what does that mean?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Yes.
Terrible. boring.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Yeah. Good bye.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Okay, Sandy.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
No.
Where to?
... You look beautiful.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Go ahead!
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
This is it.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Do you want the car?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
No. No thank you.
Yeah.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
He what?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Derek!
You happy, baby?
Derek!
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
It's your grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
I don't want to talk about it.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
What?
You fucked me, Diego.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Mom.
Actually, it was three.
Un sapo?
Family.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
What about him?
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Tuna.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Hello.
I like fire.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Out.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
George, he wasn't asking.
Are we gonna split up?
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.
I'll be here.
You swear?
I don't believe you.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Dien Bien Phu?
Sid Ahmed.
Second district ...
Third group.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
Sure ...
Why?
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
A name?
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Of course I am.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
It could've happened to anyone.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You got something on the coke?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Thanks, Mister D.
Did I say it was a natural death?
How?
What'd he die of?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Counsel approach the bench.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Aren't they all?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
No.
A little after eleven.
I assume his girlfriend.
Six years.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
You called him?
That's enough.
No.
No.  No, I don't.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
He video taped you.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
You didn't know about it before that?
Yes.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Yes.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
It won't be that hard.
You take a lot for granted.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
No -- you're not.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
Why?
I am relaxing.
Really?
I'm always open to learning new things.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Daddy -- stop it!
We were here two Christmases ago.
SO!
Why are there two deeds here?
I know. I don't understand it either.
No treasure maps, huh?
No. You can have them.
He's not coming.
'82.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
That's it.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Oh! You caught me.
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Clean?
And clean.
I think so.
I feel so embarrassed.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You get used to it.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No. But I love them just the same.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Oh, sure. Great.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
How about Italy?
Near the church.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
No. I couldn't.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
What?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Frannie.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
You people really don't like dogs.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
How the hell should I know?
Yeah?
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Damned if I know.
What it will be.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
I have to finish this for class.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Who?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Mother!  No.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
You got the shit?
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Potential toxic dump site.
That building?
How could that be?  The box was packed!
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
The same way you did before.
No!
All part of the business.
What the fuck is going on?
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
What are you talking about?
Why?
But you know he did it.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Where, then?
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Shut up!
They were in a car accident.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I should have let him kill you.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
Go right ahead, sir.
Good idea.
No.
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Caesar, you still got the money?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
All right.
...  thank you.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Sure.
What do you want?
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Shit, here we go.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Even though he knew about you?
For what?
Do you think you know me like that?
Does the case lock?
Johnnie?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah, twice.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
An accident.
He won't.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey.
Caesar wants me to stay.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...they won't let you go...
So it's time to go home.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
I don't know.
Look, maybe I should just...
...I understand...
Thanks.
Yes.
Okay.
I hadn't heard.
I don't know.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I guess so.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
No.
I didn't know this would happen.
-- how? --
-- forget it --
You could do that?
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
So get the hell out of here.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
xxxxxx
That's the only angle.
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... yer ducts.
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Beginner's luck.
Well ... well, I ...
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Ah ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
No.
It's my fucking life.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Information Retrieval.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You're not listening, mother.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Actually, I've decided ...
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I ... uh ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
No, sir.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Fixed itself.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
What?
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Mary, we really have to go.
I should be going. I just quit.
Dead.
Ten-four, hon.
He's going to be all right, right?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
No, I'd better not.
I guess there's always a chance.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Our Lady of Misery.
I think it looks good.
He's better, though, right?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
You asked me not to come.
He'll be all right.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
There's no time.
I think the worst is over.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Thanks.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
I've taken that into consideration.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Who with?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
I'm not hungry.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
He's drunk.
Faster!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You write this?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
I'll put her on.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Yes.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Did you shoot their boots?
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
As good as humanly possible.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Then it went well.
I lost six pounds...
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Sit down, stop.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Your hair's a little funny.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Wipe me out?
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I'll never tell.
I spent a fortune on this.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Okay.
I'll speak to you.
They fired me.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I don't know.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I like "godsend."
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
Yes.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
What do you mean clean?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
What?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, good.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Who?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Yes.
Good night??!
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
How can you say that to me?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I can't be.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
I'm going home!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
I already told you I'm not.
Oh...
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Carla -
Walter, I'm sorry...
Just about anything, Walter.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Hm.
Don't ask.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
I do the research.
I know, man.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
I said I did, didn't I!
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
You want me to open a window or something?
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Put it down, Walter.
Yeah?
Hm.
You're like an undercover guy!
Smack?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Turn around!
Uh, I don't know.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Suck!
Amazing!
Would you sleep with them?
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Hi.
Jealous?
You weren't home.  Like always.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
I am so sure.
You guys are thrashed.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
For the dance.
Pretty shallow of you.
I'm glad you came.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Get away from me!
) What do you think?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Nice ensemble!
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Yeah, whoops I came.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
In Virginia.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
All right.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I had to test you.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five.
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
He knows who I am!
That's the plan.
Thank you very much.
Really?
Could be.
Got that.
Oh, baby!
Nee sitch.  No way.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
What is she...
Oh, please.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
I don't think so.
I am.
Run.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You can learn to like it.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
It's all the same thing.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Yes I do...
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
You don't have to...
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I won't be needing these anymore.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
What do you believe in?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Let me.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Aren't we all?
He won't make love to me anymore.
You okay?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
What?
I can do that, too.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
You need a nickname.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Never heard of 'em.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're a cocksucker!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
I thought I was--
Well, I held it like an egg.
Gimme that.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I won't have to.
What?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Annie's a smart lady.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Let go of me!
You fuck!
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
My right.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Love to--
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
It's a league record.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a damn convention.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Why are you doing this to me?
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Yeah.
702 472 1862.
Help, Daddy!
I can't! I'm tied!
I don't know.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Eight.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Somethin', huh?
Honey, come here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Then he called me a faggot.
All right.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Hey, Rich.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
No, I don't wanna come -
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
Hey, she came to talk...
It's none of my business?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
No, a...
What people?
Well...
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
You bet.
All right, we're clear.
What can I do?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
Certainly.  Senator.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Oh, no.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Who's this?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Yeah.
It's nice isn't it?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
What do you need?
No.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
What?
Yeah, how do I know?
No, you don't.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
He needed some clothes.
Get out of here!
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
What if he won't stop?
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You fuckin' whore!
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
That's amazing.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
God! 
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Hey.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
Hey!
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Okay.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now move along.
Nicky, I did -
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Is that the last one?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
He's good. He's fine.
Mm.
Yeah.
Want me to take this for you? 
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
You're so nice. 
Mm-hm.
You did. You're right.
I did what you told me to.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Okay, yeah.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
But I saw something...
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
You do?
It means I got the money.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
He called you right here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
'Go! Go! Go!'
Listen...
Two.
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
She asleep?
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Let's get out of here.
Go fuck yourself.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
They'll do it.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Charlie M.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Then do it the way you want.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
Guilty. I am.
I don't know. I can't remember.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
And...your point?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You can't get away with..
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Stop.
Uh. "Thanks?"
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Actually, yes.
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
But I'm blind.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
I'm going to level with you officer.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
It's taken care of.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
What do you keep making me out to be?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Will you let me explain!
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
You won't disconnect.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Another minute.
How much time do you have left on it?
And that was the end of it?
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
That's not her.
I'm trying to.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The one in Brentwood.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Why can't it be her?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
I thought it was inspired.
You knew about me.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Naturally.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Got a phone in that van?
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I wish it had never been invented.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Are you trying to panic the women?
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
The fuck I will!
I thought you'd know me by now.
How do you know?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Undercover.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
Yeah.
So who's he?
Did he?
Yeah?
What do you think his name is?
Persistent.
You heard me --
Cunt.
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy?
They all get the wrong idea.
I wonder.
Must be.
Jesus.
Jesus fucking Christ.
How different?
Shouldn't I go?
Maybe.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What do you think?
I am.
Aha.
No...
I have to talk to her, Col --
Must be.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Only if you kiss me.
Not at all, honey.
You could say that.
It's a secret.
Yes.
Sorry. What you doing?
I'm going home!
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
You knew which man?
Did you hear me?
I suppose I tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let me go, Dil
I like you, Dil --
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Love you, Dil.
Fergus.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Thirty-five.
Please, Dil --
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Need to lose myself awhile.
Horny bastard.
My pleasure.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
And what happens then?
Thanks.
I'm sure.
Definitely unusual.
Good. So what do you think?
Yeah.
Am I?
I can smell her perfume.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
No.
Absolutely not.
I'll bear that in mind.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Hurry up, would you?
Shut up, would you?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
My special friend.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
What do you believe in?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I don't know her.
Stop it --
I'm sorry.
A story.
The fastest.
Got to catch me first --
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You don't know me, do you?
Who gives a fuck.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
It's all right -- look.
Relax -- you're gaining.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Let's look anyway.
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
You lied to me so many times --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
You mean spies and things like that?
We? You mean you're --?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
May I have a sandwich, please?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, I see.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
But --
Because they're still here.
That's not Carson Dyle.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Oh. Then who's this one?
1944. The next face, please.
The last one, please.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
You'll wreck your raincoat.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Me?
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Yes, but we're divorced.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Okay.
Cutting it out.
You did.
Maybe.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I dare you.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
How much is it worth?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
And if it is?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Leave me alone -- !
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is that all? Can I go now?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
No, Jean-Louis.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Quitter.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
I don't know where to go.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Lay on, MacDuff.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I believe what he said.
Ça alors! From Charles?
Because I don't love him.
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
So?
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
What's wrong?
How much further?
It can't be.
Run!
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She's still a virgin.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.

You're not?
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
Why?
Does she fuck?
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
FINE. Are you?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
No.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
This party is sick.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
That's what he said.
Who were they?
Who was the fourth?
Just thinking about something.
They're tasty.
So are you.
Told you to hide it.
If sheep don't count.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.

Oh...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Art.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.

Peace.

 Excuse me...

Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
...-er.
Am I missing somethin' here?
I did not steal this truck!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
I ain't playin' that.
Okay, okay! 
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Doesn't...


...you.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!

Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
...Night Shift, but you might...

Whoo!
You okay?
 Gee, you think so?
Hey!
 Shit. 

Come on.

...to him!  You don't know who...
I'm crazy?
Okay.  Okay.
No!


To tell you the truth, you didn't.
...miles.
...or my conscience.
...man.
Bring him down!
You all right?
Huh?
We're gonna die!

 Okay.
Go, go, go! 
  I've got the real thing!
...our ass!
...here comes the...
Tunnel.
Whoo!
What the--?
 What's it say? 
Hold this. 
Let's go!
Why'd you stay behind?!

Who had to put a gun to your head?
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, be cool.
That was quick.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
I had no idea how powerful it was.
...-lem too?

 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...

This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You have my word on that.
You'll kill us all!
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Grateful?
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
I'll do it.
Closin' down, sir.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.

We were called in by the Jerome base...
You know the suspect?

It's a hundred degrees...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...dangerous.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
I assume you have one.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
Where's Arlo?





Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...

Heat's murder.
'Course you do, Jake.
It doesn't hurt.
Would you call him a capable man?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No. She's probably scared to death.
How did you find out?
Yes... I think I can manage...
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
No thanks.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Thank you...
The apple core club.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
How are you, Lou?
Since when?
Didn't you call?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
I heard it was an accident.
Too late for what?
Yeah.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Do you know where she might be?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
What are you having?
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I don't want to drop it.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I have?
It wasn't much of a lie.
But he wasn't killed.
He told you?
Did you have affairs?
No. I'm just a snoop.
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
The Valley?
They can't be.
I gave everybody the night off.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
What were you doing there?
Doing what?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Just... I have to.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The police?
She's not tied up!
You mean she just found out?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Sure.
I want to see her.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Katherine.
She's my sister and my daughter!
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
But, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
A Miss Sessions calling.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes...
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
What about the water?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Who?
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
But...
He owned it.
Yes.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
She ran away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
You don't say?
Fifty lire... 
Toto, come here.
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Progress! It always arrives too late!
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Thais.
I can't take shorthand.
Two cents.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
You know why?  She was so -
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
Certainly not.
Yes.

Ask them to sit down.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes, Mr. kane.
It isn't finished?
Has he said when he'll finish?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I didn't say.
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
You can't.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir -
Do you know what that is?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
I'd like that.
Charlie -
Charlie -
What's wrong, Brad?
Why, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
Are you finished?
I know you will.
What do you mean by that?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Yes.
Sure.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Good!
Queer?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
What about that apartment?
What is this, a poll?
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
He went home to change for the big date.
No, this is great.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
So you're really getting married?
No, you're not really getting married?
But you were.
What?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
So what are you saying?
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Um... okay.
What time was this?
Nobody. It was closed.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Are you open?
Oooh! Navy Seals!
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
That's cheating?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Chess team Allan Harris?!
That's frightening.
You think things would be any different now?
What about Veronica?
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
And you figured it out?
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
I don't back down.
Sorry.
You've got a customer.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
We're not playing in the street.
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
I'm going with you.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Bible truth.
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
What, your dick?
I never tried it.
Listen to you.
You want to rent a movie.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Exactly.
Not yet. 
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
And this is what you rented?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Living proof.
Because I'm happy.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I'll read the book.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave me alone.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Jesus.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
What time did you get to work today?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Same time. What about you?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Helluva day.
I don't have love handles.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Jesus Christ, what next?
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
How much can you bench?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
With you? I don't think so.
It's not my store.
Actually, that's his night job.
So I'm told.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Jesus... go ahead.
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
I hate this fucking place.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Bunch of savages in this town.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Including you?
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Why do you say that?
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Dante...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I'm going to class.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
What time do you get finished?
Sure.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
WHAT?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
He's your cousin?
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I like the way you think.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I hope it feels good.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Which one?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
What?
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
It can't fly in this weather.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, fuck you.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Fine, I guess...
Okay--I don't know about this.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Nice and easy...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Just hangin' out.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
He doesn't want my help.
You attacked me.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
This rope is sixty years old!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Forget it!  I refuse!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
I burned it.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Then it's a deal.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Kill him when he gets down.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Of course. Food alright?
Thank you, sir.
No. She's dead!
Phoned some friends, sir?
Help me, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
How do you do, sir?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Alex.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You wanna be sick?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Lice?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Yes!!!
I haven't seen you before.
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Good. I'm glad
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
Yes!!!
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Prison custody?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Four in this block, sir.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Thank you.
You psychic?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
When was the last time you took one?
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Can you finish on schedule?
Wouldn't dream of it.
I don't know...
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
What's your name?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
What happens if you don't?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I'm trying...
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
Tonight it is.
Play music.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I don't understand...
I never learned jazz.
I'm not catching a melody.
Leave me alone.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Dmitri?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
I don't know.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Some living.
What's at Union Station?
One more.
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
None of your business.
Slow down.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Vincent?
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Any special reason?
The guy came right at us!
Drop me off here!
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What is?
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yeah.  I think so.
Do they have a secret handshake?
I have no idea.
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Never heard of him.
Getting rid of my hub!
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Realized what?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Okay, I will.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
This way.
What's in Connecticut?
Come on.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You do?
They'll trace it.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
<u>Liza</u>!
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I don't know...
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
The truth shall make you free.
Only on the football field.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Agent Lowry?
Tell me about it.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Tell me.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
You're --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Meaning...
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Ellie.
Actually I'm running late --
Thank you?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's a civilian facility.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Is that your official response?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
That's my girl.  Done.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
The systems integration site.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
Peter Valerian.
Actually --
Ellie --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
I'm -- I'm fine.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
Really.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
The final countdown.
Please --
-- I don't know --
I do.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
What is it?
Recommendations?
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
That's good: he earned it.
He's probably a gigolo.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Hey, Tattoo!
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Pair'a nines.
'Bout two hours left.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
A Lucas Jackson.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
You just said he could eat anything.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Cuter.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
No. No chains either.
None of your fucking business.
Only kidding!
What did I do?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
She don't want it.
You know where.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
For months... last October.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's no surprise.
Then what do you need me for?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
They get fan letters...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Not yet.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Yes.  I have to go...
<u>What</u>?...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Honest to God, Ruben!
What about her arms?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Shut up.
Right.
That's always your privilege, sir.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Because I think I'm wrong.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
And her husband? What was he?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
Are we imagining it?
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
I did this already.
Yeah, and a dimple.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
I've already made arrangements.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
I'm glad.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
No.
It's magic.
Exactly.
No rounds for another three hours.
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you?
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
So, it's over?
You like it?
Yeah?
That's Mr. Beast to you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Coming.
Always the drugs.
I guess so.
Letty, please.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why'd it happen?
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Sure. Of course.
That's a big question.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
No, no.
No.
Here's the ring.
I think I've heard this speech before.
What does that mean?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
They don't have a murder weapon?
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
You'll never get out of the city.
Where did they go?
You're there now?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Uh, yeah.
It's Daniel.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
I'm not here to negotiate.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Yes.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You want Zero to kill him?
You didn't buy batteries?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
Do I?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
You better.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
Fine.
It's me.
We had a deal.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
What'd they take?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Okay boss.
The Holiday Hotel.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
You can use my car.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
We've got to get out of here.
Relax. It will be fine.
What the hell is he talking about?
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
God, I want to go home.
No!
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
I know where she went.
What?
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
We don't know that for sure.
Take a nap.
After last night I could say the same for you.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
He is my defeated foe!
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Really?
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
What do you think?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Kneel!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I will.
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Fine.
Yes.
I left the training early.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
But Wudan does not accept women.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
What about you?
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
What does it say?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
I'm buying.
I knew that.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
No further.  I'm serious.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
How 'bout the morgue?
Fun -- look at that guy...
Who?
Mister Funboy lives there?
I have to go.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Mom tried to cook.
I don't know you.
Take the dope, too.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
T-Bird?
I can see her.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Does it hurt?
Leave me alone -- !
18k.  Crap.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
"Our" Crow...?
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Excuse me?
You what?
You didn't show it to anybody?
From who?
No.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
It's not really important.
Great book.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Without question.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Of Human Bondage.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
That's not fair.
Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
I'm sorry about that.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Any ideas who it could be?
Where did you say she's from?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Eww. No. That's gross.
It's Kathryn.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
No.
That's one way of looking at it.
You think he'll like it?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Some other time, Cecile.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
I told you to lock the door.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Likewise I'm sure.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Racist piece of shit.
What?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate it too.
She shot you down.
So what went wrong?
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
It was... Fantastic.
Excuse me?
And that's why you're leaving?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Yes, you already did.
We played backgammon?
Don't worry about it.
You're a lucky guy.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Oh, lots of times.
Sometimes.
But it's already come true.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
It's early yet.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Well, you know where it is.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
I suppose so.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
Yes, I did.
I'll show you.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
It's true.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
I'm your friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
A princess?
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Yes, Amy.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Why hasn't he got a head?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Wait a minute. Listen.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
I've changed a lot lately.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Your lips look delicious.
I've been working out.
I mean where on your body?
No, it was another woman.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
What does that have to do with me?
Anything's better than Mark.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
People notice you Frida.
Maybe he's just shy.
Only to see.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
And my bra finally fits again.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
No they're not.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
He's been here all night?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
Why not? There's been a murder.
You should have seen it erect.
So what do I do?
I think I already have.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
So you're Grant's secretary?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
I didn't have to pee then.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
This really isn't a good time.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
On your desk.
No?
Very well then. Is that all?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
So what book did you buy?
Goodnight.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
Okay.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, take it.
What makes you think I was the last one?
She's just so... pathetic.
Take some allergy medicine.
Why would you want to be a cop?
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
I told you she was innocent.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
The other one?
You are mistaken.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
I'm afraid so.
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Who?
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Then we must call the police.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
I have to go...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
We are...  living in their dreams...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Don't worry.
Great.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Clean.
Oh.  Excuse me.
He was only doing his job.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
That'd be great.
Extend things?
I see what you mean.
A teleprompter.
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
What?
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
He's not.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
Thanks, Duane.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
They asked me to help.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Oh... Okay.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
What?
Yeah... Bedtime.
We're doing our best, sir.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Come on.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
That sounds like a curse to me.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Ain't no place safe.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Knox Overstreet.
I'll tell you later.
Garden?
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I told you, that's a secret.
what?!
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
It does?  What?
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
But, Chris...
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Courtyard?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
AHHHHHH!
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Isn't there an easier way?
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
What is it?
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
I guess.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Oh. 
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
This play?
No thanks.
I'll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
Do you have to quit the play?
He's the owner...
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Dead.
I told you...
That's where my boat's moored.
It ain't any better out there!
I saved your life is what I did!
Then who are you?
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
How do you know that?
You're saying they can think?
The quiet...
Keep tasting...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
He's not coming...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Shut up!
John...
She fucked me.
Yeah.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
John,we're going huntin'.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
You're full of shit!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
Vince thinks... you know...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
I know! I fuckin' know!
What hospital is he in? Where?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But I insist.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Biederman, yes.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Linda, Linda...!
I don't know.
No.
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing.
Yeah.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Pow.
Hell no!
Merle --
You got it.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What do you think?
What do you mean?
Merle...
More bullets in the gun?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Sit down.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
What do you mean, no???
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Yeah.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Phantom Mary?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
No.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Your mother.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
You're crazy.
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
What the hell are you talking about?
How do I look?
Keep 'em busy.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
But Sergeant...
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Doucet killed my partner.
Yes.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
...What are you talking about...?
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
My granddad was a policeman.
What's your name?
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
From over the mountain --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
Young man -- you got me there.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
No, Stone!
Some other time, Stevens.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Opportunities?
I don't care.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Not long -- now.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Morning, Jabez.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You want me to go around --
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
We can still use my butter money.
Not all of it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
I am going to lock him up.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
Jabez!
All right, Jabez ...
Hard luck -- like me.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
You can talk to me ...
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
The past six months.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Go fuck yourself.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Only if New Jersey counts.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
I told you...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Sure.  Follow me.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Don't I always?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Yes, I would.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
They're not after you, they're after me.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
Yeah.  So how are you?
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
I'm sorry...
Well...
You're crazy.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
I know I am.  I know!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Do you still want the operation?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
What do you want to know that for?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
I frisk you?
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
They were ...
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
If you take anybody, please take me.
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
I'll be God damned if you will.
Special to me, too.
We like you, too.
I'm glad it's okay.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
No, that's all.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Pure?
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
How'd that happen?
What?
Dead or alive?
What kind of a deal?
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Get over there!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I want them all.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
You follow my car. 
I am.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
Oh.  Run.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
Where is the money?
Yes.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
I was a musician.
There are no bond certificates.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So, in other words, you are not down.
What?
You the man.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
That's it?
What makes Sammy run?
It's gonna be hot today.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I'm in here.
I'm working.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
I'm coming.
Yo, I'm gone.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
C Duracell.
Can ya dig it?
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Run it then.
No, just checking.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
That's it?
I work too, but I still make time.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Your memory is really getting bad.
I can't be staying long anyway.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Trust me.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Eddie Murphy.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
I understand.
Sez who?
Forget it, Mookie.
You listening to me?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Tell Vito.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Don't start on me today.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Yeah. How'd you know?
HARRY Dunne.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I know I am, Mom.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No.
Oh, is this your special place?
You brave soldier.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Who's Captain Rob?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Put some ice on it.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
HARRY! Here he comes.
Shut up!
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
No. What happened?
Who?
Yeah, that's why I asked.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Damn! What are the odds?
Try one in a million!
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
You were born free and free you should remain.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Do we have a deal?
Uh-oh. Harry?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Thanks, Pop.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
And I you.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Yes!
Who's there?
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Piter.
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Paul!!  Paul!!
The Emperor's blade.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Excellent!
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
I can't... I can't.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
No.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Where?
What can be done has been done.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
No.
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
I never thought of that.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
I don't understand.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
That's good.  I could use the money.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Mmph?  Where am I?
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Really?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Don't let me slow you down.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Soon, Bela... Soon.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Rolling.
Rolling.
What do you mean?
And who may you be?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I guessed.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
We'll do our best.
Isn't he?
What?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Better than not getting a job?
I thought he was dead.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Toss us out on our ass.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Raising money is tough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I am.  How's your father?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
No! I love sex with girls.
STOP!
Dynamite --
Yes?
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
Lines around the block.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
YES!  JUST DO IT!
So how long have you known Eddie?
Who?
Isn't that the same thing?
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Yes!
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
No, uh...
A woman wants to be pursued.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Yeah?
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
He made a mistake.
Could've been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Mom?
Oh God. What hospital?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Shari, Ray feels --
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Okay ...
Well, when you put it that way.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Yeah, well...
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Oh yeah.
I know, I ...
I really like you too...
... yeah, then, but...
No. Who?
Really? 
So?
No... Could you?
What?
Come on.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Ray --
Oh, Jesus.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Yeah.
Me?!
Me?! That's you!
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Hi.
No.
Sure.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
That's the point -- this could change things.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
pierdo.
pierdes.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Dick.
So nice
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Yeah?
Thanks, Mr. M.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Sporty.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
I've got an idea.
Take as much room as you want
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
Sure.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
And 290 "disregards," right?
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
It's not what you think.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
I'm not sure.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Yeah.  But not for long.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
What work?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah.  A great big one.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Clean?
But you were business associates?
And?
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
His blood's always up.
I'll break them, sir.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
What's this all about, lad?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
No.
What about you?
Just don't shoot me.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Of his penis, sir?
Bud White's been here?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
What's her name?
Not good enough.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Why not?
You, me and White, huh?
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
A bootleg...
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Nothing.
I don't know what that means.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen to me--
Turn on CNN.
Do it!
Why?
I don't know who he is.
Really?
Who are they?
Wait.
They're spooks.
No shit.
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Not particularly, no.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
With what?
Yes. I have her permission.
I'll say.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Why?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
I can't.
No, sir.
Not that I could see.
No.
To buy lingerie.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Listen to him.
Not a very good one, but--
Right.
I saw a man die.
No.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Yes.
Here, you can use this.
Don't count on it.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Not that much.
When do I get to meet him?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
Who's doing this?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
Bullshit.
I'm sorry about that.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
Shut the fuck up.
Oh, well, that's true.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Mr. Dean--
What are you talking--
Why?
Can I open 'em up?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Into what?
Calm down.
Why would they--
Listen to me.
To the cops?
Bobby--
Are you still in Crystal City?
Yes sir.
I said fuck you.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
He's clever. He had help.
We believe?
We don't know.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
No, but I think I do.
No.
Good.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
You bastard, I was believing you!
You will.  You will.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
We've got to get you out of here.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Yes.  Absolutely.
I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
In my room.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Okay.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
You were in Africa?
So was my Patient.
I liberated it.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Thank you.
I can already see.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Your friend?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
K is for Katharine.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
No!

I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
Yes.  Later.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Nya-nya-nya!
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
He's sleeping.
I had a hotel room.
This is making me incredibly angry.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
How awful.  What will you do?
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
I don't think so.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Exactly.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
No you can't.
Then don't.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I sincerely hope so.
So what?
You...you can't.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
It's not for sale.
Possibly.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
We are...for the tools.
Our equipment has arrived.
It was a long time ago.
A dozen times.
Charged?
To our...partnership.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Get the hell in.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
Transfer.
Right. The eight billion.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Can't be too careful.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
But--
What about you?
My god--
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Which is--
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
This better be worth 1t.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
It's those files you asked for.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
For what?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars.
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Course I did.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
What, you think I'm made of money?
Erin --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Did he say why?
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
How come you're not eating?
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
I do.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
I didn't say that.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
I can't leave my job, George.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I will.  Bye.
That's okay.  I understand.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
What's going on?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
What?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
I can help them!
You won't.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
What happened?
Barks his agreement.
Barks his agreement.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
And what are they, pray tell?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Or you ran into something ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I'm against that.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
That's quite a compliment.
Try and control this ...
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
A mining colony.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Repairs ...
I'm sorry too.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
You may call me Leia.
Not really.
... we're the bait.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Closer?!
Well, what now?
What are you talking about?
Han's leaving?
I've never seen it fail.
Why not me?
I thought I was in good shape.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
That is why you fail.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
No! .... Never ....
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Please
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Go on now. Do as I say.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
You told me he was dead.
Where?
What?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Don't lie to me.
I got a new deal for you.
Can you land?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
So where's Plissken?
Where?
Who?
Thank God.
Yeah.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
It is deep...
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
The dragon! There...
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
Your mother told you that?
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
Well hurry then, and get it.
You freed it, son?
Ye...
You, my lord.
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
You didn't ask!
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hi, how'd your day go?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
We still don't know.
Please.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Really? wow.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
What!
No thanks Karl.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Please go away.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
No I didn't know you had one.
No.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
But how?
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Are you sure?
No.
Um........Stuff.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
The closet
Captain Howdy.
What?
But you like him.
How do you know?
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
I stole it.
Stealing is a sin.
How's the girl?
Sure.
I'm not Regan.
In here. With us.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Ego te abslovo.
Who are you?
Oh really, when?
No momma.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Amen
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
I once did a paper on it
From the psychiatric end.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Are you a relative?
Just a minute.
Twelve.
Sometimes.
I don't know.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You're not going to drive.
No.
Little slow tonight.
It's all there.  Both nights.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
We have some lotion.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Baker.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
How will he eat?
Two at a time?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
My pleasure.
Frank.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Jack...
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
No thanks.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
What?
No.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
Talk.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
It never was.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
It's early.
She'll get here.
Come on, stand still.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
She's here.
I'll take my chances.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Two years ago.  March.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Fine.
No. Why?
She's a big girl.
What?
Huh?
He was wearing a suit.
February?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Who's weak now, big brother?
This'll kill 'em.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah?
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Don't take it personally.
Impersonally.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
Where's my name?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Uh... good.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Hey.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Baker's unabridged.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
He doesn't bite.
Baker.
Not for money. With my mother.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
The Stratford.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
I guess in case one year they're not.
In and out.
I'm not upset.
Must've been a cheap date.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Look, if you want to leave...
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
You don't pick your brother.
Huh?
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Another five years, huh?
Eddie did.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.
Why not?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Yeah?
Huh? Oh, no.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Drive.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
How old is he?
A few blanks?  Like what?
Only one you've never broken.
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
We need to talk.
It's important.
So you had a nightmare.
Were you there to catch me?
Don't hang up ...
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Get rid of them.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What?
You can't blame me for trying.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Normally, I would.  But today ...
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
Have fun at work.
Gone?
Great.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Excuse me?
So you left her?  Just like that?
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
On a case by case basis...
Five thirty.  Okay.
Great room...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She wants to have an affair with me.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
I’ve got all the time in the world...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
C’mon, Jack...
It’s lovely...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Are we what, Jack?
It would help me if we were.
Uh huh...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Yeah...fine.
Because that’s where I live.
Uh huh...
You’re kidding me...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Really.
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
If you want to look at it that way...
I want it...
It’s good, right?
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Promise me again...
That’s the one...
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Youthful high spirits.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
This makes five.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Ben.  Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What about you?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
They're not costumes.
But all these people...
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Not at all.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
What in the world would give me that idea?
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
I gave him twenty.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
<Me>?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
No question of her loyalty.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
But big enough for us...
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
We're pushing oxygen today.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
And if it should take more time to get through --
I have no idea.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Then why not take it?
What about Dr. Michaels?
At an operation?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Sort of.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Was there any damage?
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
I don't think so. It's nice.
I don't know. Few munce.
Personal matters.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
GOT IT?
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
You have children?
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Yeah!
Hold on.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah, right -
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Sir? Right now?
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Know who this is?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
Yah, okay.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
...Who they playin'?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
2:30.
Mm.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
Well, they're a good outfit.
No, I didn't...
It's okay, Mike...
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
Margie Olmstead?
What'd he say?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Love ya, Margie.
Uh-huh.
Yah, ya think?
It's terrific!
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well... Why don't we...
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Really, what's that?
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Some of it, yes.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Yes?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
What?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
I suppose.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
So you're staying in tonight?
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Here.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Do you care?
What do you get out of it?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
We did make love?
What... ?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
What?
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
You fucking slut!!
... You know me?
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
This is how we fill up our lives.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
Where do you want it?  In the face?
My dad.  No question.
Hum.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Good answer.
No.  Not at all.
Uh... nah...
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Homework assignment.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What are you doing?!
Why do people think I'm you?
What... what are you saying?
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
Stop finishing...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
I quit.
What?
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Yes, it is.
You're welcome to join our club.
How'd you know?
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
How you doing in there, hero?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Blow me.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Take my van!
Yeah?
Yeah, so what happened?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Clean up?  I don't...
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I know, Dad.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
Who am I, David Blane?
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Let us out!
Get out! Get out of the car!
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
In Death...
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
That's what I'm doin'!
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
That's right, buddy.
No.
Star Wars?
One hundred.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
There's a compass in the handle.
There are no worse places.
No cigarettes.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
I thought he was with you.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
What's the plan?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
American.  Come to get you out.
Am I out of here?
Yeah.  Big time.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Well did you or didn't you?
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Well, there's nobody special!
Really?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Uh... basement I think...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
How much?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
The Little People?
But I can't get it... He's...
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Bingo!
Sure...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
I don't like horror movies!
Got any Ethel Merman?
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
You don't have to say that.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
You have a disease.
Twinky?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
That's right, hand.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
What the hell is that?
No.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
I don't know.
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
I didn't get it, did I?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
That's good.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Oh, well, what, what's he...
A couple of months.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
There's nothing to say, Tita...
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
What would I do with it? Run amok?
I didn't have any.
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
That's right.
That's what you said?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
What?
All right, let's have a rematch.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
That's an old maid's tale.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Steam.
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Oh, for pity's sake...
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Wussup.
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
I can't!
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
She lives near Eddie?
Wha'?
Yeah.
Positive.
Not really.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Fletch, this is dumb.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
Not a prayer.
We play tennis at the club.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Your aunt?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
He'll be so relieved.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Check.
Since he moved to L.A.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
No problem.
What's that?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
Why not?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Can I steal you for a minute?
I wonder if that's his doctor.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
No, thank you.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Preoccupied with what?
I love the outfits.
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Here, take mine.
It's amazing.
Depends on the question.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Why did you do it?
Yeah.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
How do you know about that?
What does all this mean?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Act natural.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Very good, sir.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
My secretary.
In a minute!
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you...
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Thanks, I needed that.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
What?
Why are all these people after me?
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Ye-ah.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
There's that question...
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
And hey, I appreciate it...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
I'm off it!
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Only on a first name basis.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
What?
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
No. 
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Il fallait le faire.
Mmm.
You're for real?
What's he do?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Where the hell is it?
Strike out, eh?
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Drink this.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Four.
Hiya, Jesus.
Just for mistakes of parking?
Darling, may I have this one?
Well, I think you do.
So what?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
I'm alright, Gibby.
You alright?
Sure.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Huh?
Uh huh...
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Johnny...?
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
You really wanna know?
H-hi.
I'm right here, Dad.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
Hang on.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
Huh?
Gordo?
Whoa, I just...I just...
Yeah.  That's it.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Yeah.  Sure.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
So how are things at the hospital?
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I hear that.
You have the right to speak to an att --
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
I don't know...
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Are you all right, Shelly?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Stop the car!  Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
It was nothing.
Damn you, Shelly!
I have to.
I just want you to like me.
Great.  Just great.
Who's Horace?
I wish it was.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
My ass.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Uh...yes.  But...
Nancy.
Why?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
There's no time for this bullshit...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
So let's talk.
Yes.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
I know everything about you, Diana.
Do you have to ask?
June the 19th.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Her name's Stephanie.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
Until I hear the truth.
I mean really never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
We have to get off this ship!!
Don't be ridiculous!
Perfectly.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Oh dear God...
He is not.
You're telling a lie.
I'm staying.
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
Just felt a little chill.
Really?
It's not that simple.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
But I didn't get you one...
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
Asbestos lining.
What do I exude?
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
I say we go.
Do not inhale.
Here we go.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Where is it?
It's your best play, Nicky.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
You know about Adele.
Our Peter?
That's completely crazy.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
First you tell me.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What's sexy?
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
Two-all after six.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Washed away.
I'm at the door.
Get yourself something to eat.
You know the answer to that.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Oh yeah?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Life is good.
Because God loves a winner.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
Engaging.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
Well, we shall try.
Going nearer to God!
It was one incident.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Who's leading them?
Have you found him?
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
I like football.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Blood.  From the vein.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Where do we start?
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
It's okay, Eugene.
They found my eyelash.
Good choice.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
Michael's.
How long?
Not bad, Jerome.
I'm travelling too.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
How tall are you?
I was at home.
In the South Wing.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Let's walk.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
We could go together one day.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I'm not doing it.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I bet.
Get it over with...
No way. I've got to get out now.
I've been doing my homework.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
No. It's been a long time.
After four years and now the question comes up.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Want to cry now?
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
Do it my way.
What do we do?
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
El Paso.
I think so... I don't know.
Sure...
Who was it?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
I kinda doubt it.
'Bout five thousand.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
Can he trust you?
Yeah.
What about?
Jack, you're wrong.
That's nice.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
I work for him.
No, do you really?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
No. I didn't know that.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Not entirely. No.
Sure I'm sure.
What girl?
Your brother? What you talking about?
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Yeah.
They said he was drunk.
Yeah.
Thanks.
No. Really, I am.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Ta-ra.
They came back?
What about Keith?
Pension him off.
What's that supposed to mean?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
It would be. If they were still living.
Making a living.
Still got your sense of humour.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Piss off, Ray.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
I have to. Things to see to.
Shut up.
Shut up.
I'm not?
I had to.
To get on the...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
Some contest board...
It's not right.
No.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
Yes.
With River Oaks?
What?
What hard part?
You...
Men come work for you...
What?
Someone should hurt them.
How?
What? 
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
What did he say?
You're saying "me."
I'm sorry?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Why would I do it?
So I'm making it concrete.
Yes.
They stole the...
They stole the phones.
Down the street.
...what am I going to do all month...
To the cops?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Was I?
No.
Where did Moss...?  I...
You understand?
We had a robbery. 
In school.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Go to lunch, will you...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Excuse me, sir...
Who are you?
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
Roma.
Murray...
Yes.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
I can't split them.
Yes, I am.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
I...
What sales?
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
I'm sorry.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
He's right, Williamson.
Yes.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Twelve-fifteen.
Me.
Gimlet.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
To change our minds.
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
I don't know.
We're going to speak to her.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
What does that mean?
I...
I...
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
You going to turn State's?
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
You did that?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Three.
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Yes.
Just a few days.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Michael...
A hundred years...it's a toast.
No, Dad.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
But, you told me yourself...
We have time.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
What?
Why?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Mike, at three and a half...
I don't know.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Not for a few years.
Yes.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
No.
I deny his every charge.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Keep them alive.
And?
Sitting right behind you.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
The same assurance we got from you.
We got friends in the commission.
What was that?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
I didn't mean to...
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Expect nothing fancy.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Well...no, not really --
What do I do?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Nice place.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Did you now?
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
But we have to match the other sketch.
What happened?
You first.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You're talking through your hat now.
You're the one who started it.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
No harm done.
Clayton is fine.
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Run for what?
No.  Definitely not.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What happened?
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Your friend?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
Oh Clayton.
You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
Good.  Fine.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Oh dear.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Go.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
I don't mind.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Head.  Not heart.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
How ya doing?
I don't want him hurt...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
You know my back.
No...
Kip.
Your girl works in there ...
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
It's arright ...
Of course ...
What time of year?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What do you say, Toby?,
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Damn crooks is everywhere --
I dunno ...
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Me...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Thank-you ...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What?
What?
I know. I've missed you, too
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Run it...
Hospital.
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
What are you doing here?
On account of me.
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Are you considering a comeback tour?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Who's "Eleanor?"
You sure I can't go with ya?
Checkin' it out
Shit all looks the same here --
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Oh I Him.
Nods again.
I understand.
Liar!
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
What are you talking about?
Jezuz Christ!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
You what?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
Done.
I can't make any more deliveries.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy  ...
No, no. It's okay.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I got dry cleaning.
What? Come on!
--or a tail--
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Why not?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
You caught that, huh?
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
That's one aspect of what we do.
It's touching me.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
--But--
Yeah, can I help you?
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
Of course.
It's an integer proof.
--Half-red, half-black--
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
I did.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Since Nancy died.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
I think so.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
--I don't have any anger at you--
Me too.
I don't know. India maybe.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
There is somebody...
He was my roommate in college.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
What places?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
--Well, maybe that means you.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
You've never been out of Boston.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
You're kiddin' me.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I don't know.
Define that.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
It sure ain't good.
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
So you just want to use me and go?
Okay...
Yes you were.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Not a chance.
Bullshit.
We'll do that.
How the hell did you do that?
Exactly.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Like me?
Come one Will. I just want to know.
No.
How do you know that?
Yeah, but how do you know?
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What am I scared of?
I'm not honest?
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
How 'bout you?
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Don't hold me so tight.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
I guess that's what he looked like.
What'd he look like again?
What's it to you?
Joad.
Two.
Two.
Which way is House 25?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Got a warrant?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Have a little snort?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
Just around that next bend.
I never heard nothin' about it.
What you figger to do?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
Thought you was in jail.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Lissen, I heard that before--
Want to work, do you?
Can't you see that sticker?
Hush!
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
California.
No plants.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
I'll walk back.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Don't taste bad.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
They killed Casy first.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
There, them stripy ones.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
We gonna take whatever they got.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
I wisht it was day.
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
I never--
Morning.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
In the corporate offices.
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
Really...? So what?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Yes.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Not much else.
Where have I been?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Yep.
Well, there's not much to tell.
Bad television.
Unbelievable.
As long as I get the laugh.
Okay... Hold on...
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No.
That's probably a good idea.
Come on.
I just know.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
What stuff?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
He using her.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
I've looked at it.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
Jim?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
He gave me a great deal.
Work's good for the soul.
To shoot you. Correct.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
It is cocktail hour yet?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
What's that to miss?
Does Chicago count?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Need a lift?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
The point was to love each other.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
I don't care.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
I said... I started.
What?... Oh baby...
That's not true.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Yeah. Bye.
We're very lucky.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Yeah.
No.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Okay.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
You!
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
What does that mean?
I want to watch.
So?
NO!
Sometimes.
Honey... I was always good.
Don't move!
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
What is it with this guy?
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
...as they snoop onto us.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Difficulty rating?
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Mm-hmm.
Hmmm.
And unpack.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
What's going on?
What's this one eat?
Fucked if I care, man.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Yeah! Sure.
Think you can do better?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
If I win, you become my slave.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Do my ears deceive me?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Joey, Joey...
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Hey, it's me.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Excuse me?
Congratulations.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
555-4202.
You don't owe me anything.
Michael Myers.
What does that mean?
Get back!
Get up there Rachel!
About what?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
No way. No how.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Hi Jamie.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
Least I'm not alone.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
What's going on?
You blame everything on kids.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Fun-ny. See you.
I have a place for that.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Okay. Bye.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Just answer the damn phone.
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Are you sure?
Lee Brackett.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
He isn't a man.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I found the car! He's here!
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Hi, Tommy.
Sure. Sure.
I don't like that story.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
I promise.
Tommy, let me in!
What is it, Laurie?
Yes.
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Only minimum security.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Come in, come in.
Oh, listen...
I can't believe it!
Well, let's hope so.
Oh--
You want to see some?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Uh...
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Uh-huh.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
This time I really think I have something.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Like what?
Yeah?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No, I don't have time.
I'm...all right.
No, I don't think so.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
I know!  I know!
I know.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Was I?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Are you in love with someone else?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Mmm...
Yeah.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I'm saying it now!
Yeah.
Who is it?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
You know... 
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
But not you.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Okay.
Why?
Oh...
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I think so.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
That's a beauty!
Well, then a third opinion.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
True.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Will you just tell me one thing?
She really does, though.
He's not a loser at all!
Singing?
Really?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Uh-huh.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Look, everything's going your way.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Hmm!
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
I remember you.
Yeah.
We didn't hit it off.
How are you?
Oh, no.
Yeah?
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
Yeah.
Okay.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
Some museum director disappeared.
Or, perhaps...
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Now, whyn't you help us?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Have the child taken to bed.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I've never heard that he...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
That could be.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
Enchante.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Where do you live?
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...what did you want? 
And why should we believe you?
What shape is the scar?
...yes, yes, yes....
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...no...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
That's right.
Yes.
...yes...?
Because?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
Why are you...don't stop...why?
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
You have no idea. Now run away.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Say Hi for me.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
You're all making me blush...
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?

This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!

I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Do you really think I care?
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Shoot.
Ronnie!
You're beautiful.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Never say never.
You goddamn bitch!
Heather? Wha...
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Suicide is a private thing.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Yeah, great.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Goddamn Geek!
Shut the fuck up, all right.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
What's that?
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
But she'll have no one to look after her!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
He . . .
That . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
All right, then.
Your insight is enlightening.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Yeah, how's that?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Someone special.
I've been in here before.
Zero's a number right?
What's that?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
What?
Really, why's that?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
No please make yourself at home.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Two.
Wow you are out of it.  
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
Try stupid.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
LaPlante!
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Lie, you mean...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
What picture?
Uh, no.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Vietnam!
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
That's not what I mean...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
Unprofessional.
You're sitting on your ticket.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
What's "cynical"?
You didn't?
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
So this really does the trick, eh?
They're really white.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
That would be stupid.
-- a sense of proportion.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Isn't that always the way?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
About us.
I'm thirsty.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've asked him what's wrong.
Here, take this out to the table.
What?
What's that?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Where should I hide the car keys?
Did you lock the garage door?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Oh, honey.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I'm having the floor fixed,
We'll talk in the morning.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Grow up, Dreyer.
I didn't.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
The thermometer's broken.
And I can't help having a cold.
Not now.  I'm busy.
They appear to be authentic.
What is it?
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
A few days ago.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
If it came down to it what would you do?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
Living.  Remember?
It's done.
She's a treasure she is.
How?
I lied.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Why not?
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Aye.
Are you a cop?
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
No.
You?
It will end tonight.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
How could they get by him?
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Why did you wait?
I know.
I love you, Conner.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
I think he's dead!
It was stolen.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
What do you want to do?
I understand.
I'll make the call.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
He knows better than that.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
What are you talking about?
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I'm here.
Okay.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Use more ice.
Dennis.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Keeps to himself, more like.
It won't be a problem.
You said they would be here!
Where is it?
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Just one question.  Please.
Another minute.  Please --
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Not until the man calls.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
These disks . . . where are they?
Your phony FBI assholes.
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Cockroaches?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Let me see your identity card.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
What did you overhear?
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Whiskey?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I am on a list! What list?
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
You have no whiskey?
Why not? We are half way there already.
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
For supplies, you drive.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
That will take time.
Call, sir?
What cards?
I need a great favor.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
What?
We must do something.
I couldn't help.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Murdered! By whom?
Stay with the children.
Get in.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
No, no.
You cannot go alone.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
Yes.
Tell me what it was.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Why?
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
The staff, the guests.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
And what's Steven's status?
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
More to the point. Where's our host?
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Ms. Marr!
Three times, to be exact.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
As a tumor.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Did it work?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
Up here --
Take the gun.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
No...not air --
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
Let's try down here...
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
It'll have to do.
We're safe?
For chrissake give me a hand!
I don't do groups.
You've got your own TV show?
I hope not.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
Question answered.
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
Believe me, we need to.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Blackburn's dead.
-- ten.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- I'm coming --
You say you saw some activity here?
Yes.  It was.
Good-bye.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
She talks to me.
Ok...
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
Where is she?
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Or what she was worth.
Ok.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
What about keeping an open mind?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
She's gone!
Should I...
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
How can I help you?
Good night.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What are you getting at!
It will not take long...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Yes, they are.
Oh.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
What?
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Right.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Who's that?
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Would you know this store again?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
I laughed, I cried.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
You re not thinking of going to...
Why not just go now?
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Anna, I think you better stay....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Let's just forget it, I mean...
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
How long were you in?
Uh....old badminton injury.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
I guess that's a no.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You certainly do.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
I'm plenty happy!
Adenoids?
He didn't offer you money.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
-- or lack thereof?
I know that, Amy.
You don't say.
Every year?
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Oh Norville, I --
I'm sure you do.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
This I know, Benny.
I --
Huh?! But, buddy --
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Norville.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
I haven't had --
I --
Well, I made the dean's list.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Yeah, tell me about it.
Ya get the special?
Old Faithful.
She is!
She's damn good, Lou.
Thank you for waking me.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
It'll wait.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
You can't really believe that.
I am not a frightened girl.
Of course not!
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Good morning.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
Why did you come in here?
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I imagined this so differently...
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Why?
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Got a meeting uptown.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
I wasn't star--
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Good night.
So early?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
You think I --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Hi Wendy.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Educated guess.
They say you never forget.
Forget how to ride a bike.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
Moisture! Moisture!
Great, thanks for the tip.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Sure, anything but this English.
Out.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Watching what?
Greetings, Charles.
Can I come?
Charles, what time is it?
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
What's that, then?
What's the D.A. got them on?
Too bad...
Actually...
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
But there wasn't any...
Twelve years younger.
Then change it.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
Has her books in it.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
Even the best make mistakes.
To do nothing.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
What kind of stuff?
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You're not missing much.
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Thought you wanted something fun...
That's what I said.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
But you wanted to.
Yes.
Told you I could write an ending.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
No back-up.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Ah! You have questions?
Listen to me.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You said there were none.
Yes... My God...
I can't save her.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
What night? What do you mean?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
He jests.
Sit still. It's not finished -
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Give it to me!!!
I want it!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Sure...
Fascination...
Paris? You came from Paris?
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
No...
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Yes.
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
Yes!
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
What about a radio?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Who? Who is here?
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Don't even think about it.
Yes.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
They never found the body.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Come on, you can make it.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
It's okay.
Will you try...for me, please?
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Fine. Show me the body.
Who?
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Rio, baby!
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Hey --
I don't know, but I'm starving.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
No. I shot him.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
So why are you still here?
You don't have to be a jerk.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Drunk again?
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
I was looking for you.
What an odd question!
But one must love a father.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
That your father and I ——
You wouldn't tell that ——
Her name is Thea?
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
You are my friend.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
He hates all my race.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Well, who are you, then?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
The Building and what?
They went out of business years ago.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Hiya, George!
All right.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Well, what happened to you?
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Give the flower a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I know –– I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Goodbye, Sam.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
No charge.
I'm all right.
Yes, sir.
Hope you enjoy it.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
Oh . . .
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Maybe you were born older, George.
What's that?
Hello, Vi.
It's important.
How do you do.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
George . . .
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Have you notified the police?
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
I'm going to scream!
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Have you made up your mind?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Would you rather leave?
Well, then, sit down.
Thank you.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
That does it –– come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Hi.
Yeah, just started.
George, darling! Where have you been?
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
You going to the lighthouse?
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
Someone pop your balloon?
I think we're changing course a little.
Back down!
Swim for it!
They're moving pretty fast.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Sean!  Catch it!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
If there is, develop it!
Got it.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Not till next year.
I kind of had plans....
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
What else you got?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
My ass!
First things first.
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
That's it.
Is there one in these waters?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Careful.  What's wrong?
Terrific.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
Going out.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
I know, I know....
It's still a good idea.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
What?
What for?
That's it?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Shouldn't he be at home?
What's daddy doing?
Hiya yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
Huh?
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
And second?
Figure they split?
I'm not sure I can.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Might as well.
Coming about, then.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Brody's riding his tower.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I can get it.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Want another one?
What is it, 97 days?
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Yes.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No, you're not.
Me, too.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Well, that's why you got it.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Who's going to do it?
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
No, no.  That won't do.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
So do I, love.
Why are you?
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Get ready to go.
Brian, he's coming around!
How'd it get in here?!
They still seem nervous.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
Don't blame yourself.
Sure.
Are you really?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Come on!  Check this out!
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Buzz off.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
No way.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
So was Dad.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
That's what grandmas are for.
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
We need beer....
I'm not on vacation....
I like it.  Really....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
It's beginning....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Thank you....
Who's coming?
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
Why'd you come out here?
Promise me....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
Sure you can....
No one does till they learn....
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
No, you're not....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You got a better idea...?
She said it was coming....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Feathers all over the place....
Stop busting my hump....
Will you leave me alone...?
The readings suck....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Put me down....
Where the hell's the beer...?
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Down here....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When we got the grant....
What?
As long as he's been here....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Maybe it's gone....
I'm going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'Snuck up on me....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
You don't like my voice...?
I've got to get to her....
It'll work....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
No way....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
When he has a pillow over his head....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
What?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Not too good in daylight ..
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Are you sure you didn't call?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
I don't see that at all ..
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Three or four.
And did they?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Hamlet. Have you read it?
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
How d'you know what I'm like?
Which is what?
No I'm not.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I wanna be near you ...
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Whass going on here?
Ask him.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
I see what you're saying.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Hmm.  Pretty good.
My son... my mind...
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Hello?
Thanks.
We will be fine!
Yeah, what happened there.
Right.  I'll come in.
Oh hell yes.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Of course I know --
He's in the living room asleep.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
No--
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Why not?
I understand your anxiety.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
You.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Fine.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
No.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Fine.
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
I'm not your brother!
Hi Ray.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
One way to find out.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
People change.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
I filmed this the morning they left.
No, it's...
Eric!
That one time was just the bumper.
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
Who's that?
Where is it?
He loves you too.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
I want to be an astronaut.
But then you never get to go in space.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
You should.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
But you never came across just one.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
It certainly does.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Not without a shot of the nest.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
To collect my fee.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Good.
Why?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
What's that?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
Are you insane?!
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
I believe in him.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
You're sure we have to?
Damn!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
What now?
'Bout thirty seconds.
Six weeks?
Oh my God.
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
Alan!
Okay.
I get ah - -
And scary.
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Hola, bienvenido
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Really?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
I doubt it.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Nope.
We gotta do something.
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
What kind of opinions?
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Let's get you out.
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That was great!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Who is this? What's going on?
What about that other guy?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
So?
None of that's true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Insomnolesence...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
So what do we do?
Not yet.
Great.	When can you do it?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
How's that possible?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
Yes -- that's us.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
In a manner of speaking.
Another one?
You're detestable.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Tonight?
He was murdered.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
I've heard of it happening.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
I don't know.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
You mean you've actually begun some?
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Then why haven't I been --
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
... A piece of paper ...
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
Orlac is an account?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Ludwig?
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
It's ... lovely.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
I photographed it extensively, father.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
That's too bad.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
That's your monkey, Denham.
What?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Yeah.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Please --
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Sorry. 
Didn't want you.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Yes -- all right --
Will you let me go then?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I said yes, I see.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
No, I'm look --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
OK.
I go on rounds.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Yeah, you got to me.
Not much point to this, is there?
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Thanks.
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
How?
We did this before.
Mm.
Yeah.
What am I supposed to say?
What?
I was wondering what that was.
Don't touch anything.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
You're going back?
I am.
About what?
I believed her, Pete.
How is it back there?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
It's not so bad.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Then how are you involved?
I looked it up.
Yeah.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Trask --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Show...
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
I'm allergic to onions.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sure.  Lots of times.
It's my name too.
Uh huh...
Who will read me my stories?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Overruled.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Yes, your honor.
Then I have concluded my questions.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection!
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
No questions.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Yes.
No.
No.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Do you have a lover now?
So do you.
You want what?!
Such as?
Ted, do you love him?
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I don't know, Jim...
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
What?!?
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
How the hell are you going to do that?
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
I understand.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Three.  And add some basil.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
A moment.
Khambas are wild men.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
No cried?
Can I free the prisoners?
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
General Chiang.
Soon.
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
How many?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. Not very big.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
I will not go.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Good day.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
You cannot.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
I will miss you.
Eliminate you.
What would you do, Holiness?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
It happens when I land.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Cocktail?
No!!  Out!
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Raincheck.
Then do it!!
We both know what they'll do.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Are you sure?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Oh, bullshit.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
I <u>told</u> you.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
It's okay.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
He's floating.  Take it home.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
White perch.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
You too.
Seconds.  Three, four.
What kind of backup do we have?
I thought I saw...
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
What?
Kevin, hey.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Kelly--
Backstabber?
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Thanks, Ardelia.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
Well, except for the one girl.
I will... I promise.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
That wasn't me.
I think we may be, yes.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
But if he knew we have so little time -
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Sewing...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Sometimes you do.
May I see your credentials?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Maybe they'll catch up.
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Who killed your patient?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
How long did you live there?
Why so briefly?
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
No! That's incidental.
All right, then tell me how -
What was it?
Yes...
Yes. I'll tell you.
Dr. Lecter -
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Why did they turn back?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Miss.  May I?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
...never doubt what you are doing.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
And what is that?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
Fire!
Wampum?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
And this?
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Granted.
Granted, Monsieur.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What?...
No.
You screw around like that again and--
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
How much time does that give us?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Roger.
And it killed Bo?
Beautiful.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Not yet.
Timex...
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Who cares?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I'm going to kill it!
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Under there?
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Sixpack...
I ought to smack your face!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Your pocket?
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Hardly.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Er well, yes we do.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Just give me the keys.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Hit the fuckers.
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
He means they're thieving dogs.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
For half a million?
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
That's going on optimism.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
So?
Oh, come on, Amado--
I can't take any more school.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
I can fix cars.
The--the officers.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
He'll live.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
We were just dancing--
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
He a Black man or an Indian?
The Trail of Tears.
You know who I am?
That guy who got shot--
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
You own this place?
Made some money, came back here--
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
It's a lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
We should just do it.
That ring--
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was crossin' the river--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
We have a murder?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
The Sheriff.
You ever play one of these?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Okay? He's not here?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
How much you got left?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
They've got my Amado.
We haven't talked since high school.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You've got your mother, your kids--
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
What was your father's name?
Couple months before I was born--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I appreciate you telling me.
Just doing my job.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
Uh-huh.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Thirty-five bucks.
How?
Nope.
Knew what?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
I know him.  I saw him.
He won't.
What is he?
Yes...
Yes.
You don't?
And you don't ask questions?
Do you?
You haven't seen anything yet.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
It was more than that, I think.
Some or it.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Hang on!
You can't.
I... have... to.
I think so.
Good.  There.  Yes?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
--vanished.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'm here to offer you a job.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Shut up!
No.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
A Mister Quaid?
I won't say anything.
Does anybody?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Have you been in?
He deserved it.
Is that all?
And you believed him?
Yes.
He's better off this way.
I don't know.
What?
What about Philip Swann?
Is he the Puritan?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Not true.
Yes.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You'll do it?
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
OK, see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Because that would be too easy.
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
No, we'll find something around here.
A coke.
Around.
That's what you said the other night.
Hi, Bob.
Yes.
Oh?
Hello, darling.
What?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Do you want I send it to your room?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Do you think they have a room here?
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Claire...
Peter, are you okay?
My secretary?
I hope so.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Please, the children.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What?
What's the bible for?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
It's Detective Smythe.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
The blue.
Thanks, sweetheart.
You're a caterer?
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Yes, we appreciate that.
What?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Always on my ass, anyway.
No one's forcing her.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Oh, great.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Chances are there's still a chance.
I was just playing ball.
Just wanted to say good game.
Just like that?
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
Lucky.
He works at a bank.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
Kay.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
I don't.
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
God, here we go.
You either.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Fine, Quincy.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Right here.
You're not stupid.
Nobody.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
What the hell's going on?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
A rest?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
We need to talk.
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
So you're gonna bitch up?
Well, can you give him this for me?
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
What's that, not great?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
I've been hearing you.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
No.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
ooohhhhhh no.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
I'm coming!
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
It's fine.
You just move in here?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I don't have a boyfriend.
-- is not my boyfriend.
You won't.  You won't have to.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
What's that stand for?
I'm sorry.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
I'm sorry --
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You don't know how crazy I am.
I've got troubles.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
Yes.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
I don't know.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
-- no.
Son, please, now....
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
That's confidential information, little man.
No Can Do.
No.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Finish it up without the lip.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
This sounds threatening.
Well --
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
What?
-- Samuel Johnson.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Stay that way.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Gently, son --
Don't do this, Don.
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
She loves you.
No.
Twelve.
Alright.  Thank you.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
-- fuck you.
Around here.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
...are you Phil...?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
And what about screaming?
What's this, how did this happen?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
I won't.
I got in trouble at school.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Are you alright?
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
I don't know what I've done.
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm her father.
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
What's MOW?
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Hi.
mmmhmm.
...I don't....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
818-753-0088.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
I need this one.
Sure.
I'm fine. nothing.
Alright.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
This happens....this is something that happens.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
And you were not hurt?
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Shut up, knave!
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days??!!
But -- what is he doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
To the Bastille.  And death.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
There are more important things than tits.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Who?
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
What is its antidote?
How did you --
Phillippe.  Rest now.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
At least help Raoul.
... tired.  Must... lie down.
... You knew you had a double?
Forgive?!
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
What was the end page?
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
I... we are humble people...
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Gotta come from somewhere...
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Yeah?
You're the mysterious type, right?
No...
You'll find out - soon enough.
No.  A witness.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
I killed them.
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
OK...where do you want to start?
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm going to need a way to get there.
That was Peterson upstairs.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
How are Molly and the boy?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
When do they go to press?
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Book code?
Library of Congress.
I have to.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Somebody hurt him?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I am all right.
You said the guy down here is good.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
No other possibilities?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
That's narrow?
There's no connection between the families.
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
He went to the men's room.
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
In eight days.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
It's a surprise.
Yes, are you okay...?!
Francis? Where are you?
Me.
The Tooth...
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me.
Absolutely,
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Uh... sure...
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Why do you think I called?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Cut the general crap.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What about the dog?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
And you said?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Tell me about yourself.
I have to see somebody.
Blue, then.
Will...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will?  You could come up here.
That's not true.
Go on to the house.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Yes.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
...after a while.
...yes.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
No.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
What do you want?
Fight what?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Yes.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Andy!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
Twenty!
I'm here, ain't I?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I can shtop whenever I want...
It's me.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
You're a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Are you sure?
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Why isn't he MOVING??
And you are?
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
If you get caught using that --
Right...
I don't know... My computer...
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
An accident?!
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Sorry.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
How?
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
But what if...?
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
The agents --
What do you know?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
You -- you're too fast.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
I think I do.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Why?
Morpheus, I don't know --
Good.
Do it!
How did you know...?
Who?
What?
What do you mean, without him?
What?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
... shit.
No.
There has to be something that we can do.
I'm going in after him.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
Do what?
Not yet.
No.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I'll be all right.
I can't!
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Thanks.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Be careful.
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
No.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Panther!  Same thing...
Not quite...but keep trying.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Should I slap him?
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No you're not...
No.
No.
What pipes?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
OK, get in.
Get him in.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
How much was the original loan again?
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Fine.
I know.
Hostess?
Chinese food?
Yes, you did.
Ok.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Wha?
Anything specific?
What is it now?
Did you?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
I know...I know.
You could say that.
Quiet please.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
He's coming.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
No.
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Do they, m'dear?
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Both.
I thought you were buying my company.
Right away.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
Then why did you bring it up?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Yours.
Don't you want to hear the details?
Certainly, Bill.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Make it go 'way.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
I didn't know that.
You love Allison, don't you?
I'm sorry.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
Do you love Drew?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Watch me do what?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Girlfriend?
Why don't you get off his case?
And is your heart beating strangely?
How beautiful.
Then don't.
Don't.  That will come later.
I won't.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
I guess so.
I understand.
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
It's all yours.
Why didn't you stop me?
I wouldn't put it that way.
That's okay.
Just a manner of speaking.
I'm her father!
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Not at all.
Say again?
That's life.  What can I tell you?
I am not a dream.
'...Yes --'
You fill the bill, Bill.
What?
It's enough now.
Thank you, Quince.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Yes, I believe I do.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I know it's none of my business --
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
Yer damn right.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
Oh, yes --
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
That's the thing. I have this condition.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
What's it like?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Then why is this my handwriting?
Leonard.
Yeah?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Thanks.
Yeah, I remember you.
Don't say anything else.
Quiet!
Strip!
Take the money and walk away!
You told me.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Who did he go to meet?
And what did he say?
Where is he?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
About your whore of a wife?
What are you here for?
How do you know about me?
So why did you come here?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
You know it?
John Gammell?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Fucking hope not.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
From who?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

Turn around.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
It's a rip and a hit.
You can't.
Yes you do...
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
She's dead...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Died in childbirth, having me...
That's right.
Why?
Do I need it?
When?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
What kind of weight?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Verdado.
No.
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Then you should.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Have faith.
How will it stand up?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Goodbye.
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
What's it say?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
"Future" of...?
Do we need this...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
For what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
What's that supposed to mean?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
You like it? Take a look.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
What of?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Get outta my way.
Ready for anything.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
...He had a bald skull and...
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
You want to split your hernia again?
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Everything.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
For the money... )
Oh Jesus! 
Sure.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
I'll pay extra
But didn't have heroin.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
A hundred grams.
He wasn't even in the car?
Hello.
Thank you.
What do you mean?
Yeah!
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Then I'll cut his balls off.
Yeah? Where?
Oh shit.
You can't take anything seriously.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
That's a great philosophy.
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
What?
H-how do I get...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Go!! Just go!!
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
We?
I heard how you talked to him.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
It didn't bite me.
Peter...
You the bug lady, right?
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
--my number one fan.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
If you wouldn't mind.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
No big deal.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
I want my pills NOW!
--cliff-hangers--
I said that?
What?
Yeah, yeah...
A toast?
I think you're right.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why would you lose me?
No, I haven't.
I'm glad you like it.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
What?
What is it?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
You're still a writer.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Great.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Not possible..
Hugh, I'm impressed..
Well, that's good, isn't?
Then don't say it.
To do what?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Ninety-three point four million.
What are you talking about?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Far right.
- torque wrench.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Can you think of a better one?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Affirmative.
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
Like?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
You mean it'll be difficult.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
She must still be on the property.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
They'll kill me.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
S.O.P..
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
All ten million.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Roger that.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
I'm going to answer it.
You don't think we're going to make it.
Is this the only way?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
This stuff is so sticky.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Yeah.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Now I want you to hold onto it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Always.
Very well.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
And a lonely ass.
Twenty minutes.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Connection denied.
Itís not working.
I always check the batteries.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
His brother.
Yes.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Ti amo.
Again?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Yes.
I don't understand.
I'm making you a steak.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
You really are stupid, you know that.
A wolf without a foot!
Don't just become excited.
Oh no I didn't!
What?
I can't!
I'll come to the wedding.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
It's the best thing there is.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Hi.
Never is a long time.
What?
What do you mean?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
And who's gonna pay for that?
No.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
It was a miracle.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Oh.
What sins have you to confess?
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
I don't know.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
I don't know.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
It was a miracle!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Sure!
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Sure.
My God, it's a mansion!
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
Oh. Right.
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Who are they?
We want ... a shrubbery!
One that looks nice.
You said it again!
What?
Had enough?
Course I have.
You'll what ... ?
My liege,  I am honored.
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
No.  No.  No!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
There.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up!
... Well, we did do the nose.
Why do you think she is a witch?
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
I'm getting better!
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
Here's one!
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
... and you'll come and get him.
No ... just keep him in here.
The Prince ... ?
Oh, I see,  Right.
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
You got my note!
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
No, no, no.
Seventy a year.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Oh, I'm much more than that.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
My own.
Back and upper corridors.
I need a man who knows where I am.
That's not good enough.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
There are important papers from --
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
I'm not married.
Why do you think I keep her here?
They aren't as watchful as you.
The greasy pole.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
What?
Are they worth reading?
What does he know about the Highlands?
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Then why send me back to them?!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
No, ma'am.
Yes.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
No, indeed.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
From whom?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, who isn't.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
What the hell are you talking about?
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
No way.
Nick, what is it.
Like the fractals?
I don't know.
I can't believe you made it!
Dante's Inferno.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
One.  In case...
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Right, then...
Never been on a snowboard.
Hold my keys, then.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
You have no time.  What is your question?
That's impossible.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
What's going on, Cynthia?
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
One.
You're an understandin' fella.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Before what?
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I don't know who I am.
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
You don't remember anything else?
Unh, unh.
Not that I can see.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
I'm all right.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Do you know them?!
And who are we auditioning for today?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Go ahead.
Oh boy.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Yeah.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Interesting.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Making ends meet, huh.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Leave him, he's dead.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm working on it.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'm not listening.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
Okay.
Fine...
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Yes.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
I don't help criminals.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look...
That's cute asshole.
Ow...
Knock yourself out.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I said NO.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Thank you, sir.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
John, sir.
Sir ?
What did you hear ?
I'm listening.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
<<belch>>
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Shut up ! It's me.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Who was that guy anyway ?
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Don't mention it.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about giving the other guy a break.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Great.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Was it a nice funeral?
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
You're being narrow-minded.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
You mean, you knew about me?
I'd like to, thanks.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
Come on in!
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I want juice!
You're so clever.
Yeah, RIGHT.
TAXI!!!
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
WHAT??
Oh my gosh, here it is!
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
He is one of the great poets.
And I thought I was weird.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
In the tar??
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Big deal.
This is a totally barbaric custom.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Part adventure...part miracle.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
They're great.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Sounds like you're very organized.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
I'll be here.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
I know, look at his little hands.
Good for you baby.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
WHAT?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Yeah, all right...
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
I think it's still available.
Pardon?
What do you mean??
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Okay.
No. Just, more activity.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Here?
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Want to what?
Yes.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
You can get the general idea...
Any more soda left?
Ahh, maybe next summer.
You never cared before.
Hi.
No, no.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Hi, is Vada home?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
He likes her.
Probably.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I am.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Thomas?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Aarrggh.
Hi.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I can't, I have to go home.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
You could pick that scab on your arm.
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
It's my mother.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Don't DO that!!
I told you i'll get in trouble.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
What?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
But I have my clothes on!
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Not true.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Well, let's spit on it.
I honestly wish I could...
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... weeks.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
We're about to find out.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You've been working on this, huh?
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Impressive.
The man you love.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
That was Thursday.
It's too late to start over.
Good girl.
You need a few dollars.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Can you watch the road?
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
I was gonna predict that.
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Exactly.
Don't you see...
That's entirely understandable.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I know Ben.
Hate that.
She finds him "personable."
What, leaving school...
I got the point.
Boy, those were the days.
No.  I've got you.
If you like.
Have you.
Me either.
Yes.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
Like family, huh?
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Right here.
Well, that just happened that time.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
You're so good.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Green.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
He knows better.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Who the hell is he?
Okay.
Where the hell have you been?
To the bathroom.
National?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Not yet.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Your brother?
How in the world did he get shot?
Hi, Sherry.
I'm not really a musician.
A little. What do you need?
I'1l get your bag.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Sixty-three.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
About three years.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Tom. You remember?
Wow!
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm not sure...
What?
You sound different. Is that really you?
Oh?
Do you study at all?
Just a minute.
He ain't really new.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be dammed.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Is that good?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
What?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Aside from the obvious?
Do you miss Mallory?
Then was it worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Says who?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
On average forty million.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Got it.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Yes.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Thanks.
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Perfecto!
Slate it.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
See Duff. He's the money man.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Where was that?
I been sendin' her money.
Like where?
Well, he worked around.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You work around town?
No thanks.
That's right.
Don't Duff--
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Are you married?
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
You still didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
There's nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Take it easy, Frankie.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
'Bye, Jocko.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Thank you.
I guess I ain't.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Omar, listen to me--
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
Why not?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
You son of a bitch...
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Are you even really alive?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
I don't have a girl.
You're pleasant tonight.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
All things possible in Babylon.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Nobody has.
Can you take me to it?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How's the ice break?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
No!... No...
I don't know. I don't know...
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
Almost two days.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
What went down between you and Riviera?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Well, do you?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Leave.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
That is lingerie.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Sometimes opposites attract.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Do I want to be crunched?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Oh. Right.
They hid my car--
Are you in special ed?
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
But I'm not a penguin.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I can't do this.
No. Josie, this is real.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
And a gymnast!
Thanks. And what are -
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You remember that story?
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Thanks. So do you.
Yeah, I have.
But now you don't have to--
I just can't look at you the same way.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
We went through the door...
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Where?
Just what?
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
Ken!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
Yeah, why?
It was okay.
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Shut up, Grady.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
I know.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed him!  I killed him!
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
I can't!
Okay, I guess.
Sure...go ahead.
Okay...thanks.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
That's right.  I don't.
I had such an awful dream.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
They're healing up nicely.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
No, she's right.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
To old friends.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
It's an amazing gift.
Sure.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
You did it the other night.
I don't know.
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Never been here before?
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
With Hypnocyl?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Doesn't matter.
Try me.
I can do that.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
No.  We're alone.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
Cooling down.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Night, night, Honey.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Films mainly.
No thanks.
No.
Thanks.  Well...
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
I thought you were leaving.
You abide by rules like that?
Step aside.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Who is it?
I haven't decided.
Is that right?
He wouldn't say.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
What's your name?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
No -- did you?
That's not fair.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
No, no.  She doesn't.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
What are the choices?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
And she's in your house.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Three.
Fabulous.
Yes.
What book?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
A vote is before the group.
No, it was irresponsible!
Thank you, ma'am.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Are they all crazies?
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Huh?
Me, too...
Me too...
A pecking party?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
With your own two hands?
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
What for?
I refuse!
I don't trust you!
No!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Yeah, it's cold!
He's not!
Hold it!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
I see...
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
'Kay!
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
Sure...
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Okay. Who else?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Big man!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Oh...
Bet you ass...
Take you han's offa me!
Why, sure, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
I thought so.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Buona notte.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Yes.  We did.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Amazing.
Hm.
My name's 
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I'm in love with you.
NO.
He's safe.
So it wasn't real.
Who says I don't love him?...
Because.  I know where he is.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Right now?
Hi.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
There is no us.
Tonight?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
What?
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Is he gay?
I don't know, Kate.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
It's a coincidence.
What about your job?
You don't have a passport.
My God, you have...
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Maybe.
You're coming with me?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What'd you find?
Larry bought himself cologne?
Sure you did.
Is he looking at us?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
What?
I'll be back before you leave.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
My God... you're right.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Uh huh.
And Larry?...
Went to high school with him. But...
She's not here.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Mania.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
I'm not thirsty.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
In a minute.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Terry... Terry... .
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
I'll get home all right now.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You training to be a nun or something?
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Do you like pigeons?
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
In a saloon?
I am?
What a fruitcake you are!
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
What for?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
Terry, what's wrong?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Get away from me.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Terry...?
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
He wanted to see me again.
Let me by.
Mind your own business, Father.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Down to the wire?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Take it easy.
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Yeah, really!
You'll work.
Raise a hand to me and... .
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Hey look-
Forty-five bills.
So-so, Johnny.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
Thanks, Johnny... .
By way of Chicago?
You ratted on us, Terry.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Keep Charley out of this.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Nothing is worth your life.
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
I will decide the conclusion.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
And the one driving the other car?
Who is it?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn't want me to.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Why don't we talk about it later?
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Sure looks that way.
Love is funny.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
I get that feeling, yeah.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
All you gotta do is get in.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You have to know what you're talking about.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Let's go outside and talk.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Not until recently.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Yes.
You won't do that.
Those guys bother you?
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
It would be worth the risk.
That's not what you were about to say.
I don't think we should get into that.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
What's to think about?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
That time?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You not with probation, one of those?
He said he stayed here last November.
I'd like that.
I see that.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
So?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Likewise.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
That's me, Sir.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Where's that lizard?
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
He did.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Home of the brave!
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Six P-40's.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
Home of the Brave.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Thank you, Sir.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
I'm not telling.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Peggy Sue!
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Just what you underlined.
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
Charlie...
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Thanks.
Good.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Let's go down to the basement.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
How'd you know about that?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You're going to listen to me.
What?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
What about Janet?
Oh, God, Dion.
Of course.
I wish she hadn't.
But I'm remembering the future.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
I hate chickens.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Doing some shopping?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
This morning was good.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
How do you feel?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
What about?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
For what?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Why not? They're my favorite.
What's inside?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Pretty much so.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
It's been a few years.
I'm going out, Dad!
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I'm not burying him here...
You never get over it.
Maybe it takes a while...
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Bob...
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
K-R-O-one.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
I said, don't worry about it.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
Close the law book.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Ready for what, baby?
A carrot?!
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
I have AIDS.
Makeup.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
As in, the vegetable?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
What?
We're friends of Beckett's.
Not bad.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What impressed you about him?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Gay movies.
Yes.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Really?
That's right.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
That's correct.
We won.
I might.
In a word, yes.
What kind of people?
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Probably since she was born.
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Helloooo...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
... It's time to get this society back on track!
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
<u>What</u>?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Look deeper.
They're coming.
Entered our minds.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
We can't make it.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
It's starting....
Not sure. Ten?
Possibly.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Let's wait on the power cells.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
We're just burnin' light here.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
What, you're goin' off, too?
Company's not here, is it?
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Riddick?
And what about the cells?
There is no "safe."
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
I'm born-again.
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Not staying in here another....
Oh, so I'm disposable?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Well, you got the big gauge.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
No. She's not.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Just realized that, huh?
Not if I'm the one.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What are you doing there?
No.
Remembers what?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
That way.
None at all.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
The Hunt Club.
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
My name is Taylor.
Read it yourself.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Taylor, please --
Taylor, you can't.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Yes, Sir.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
But there's the doll, sir.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
No!
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
Nah...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
You know what I'm talking about!
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Not tonight.
I'm sure you have.
How careful should I be?
Just drunk enough.
Possibly, Miss.
No, please.
I see.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
Much too late.
I don't.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
No thanks.
Quarter after one. Why?
Just who are you, anyway?
They know you here--know your name.
Couldn't be.
Absolutely sure.
All right--following me.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
They'll look for you.
Killaine...
This must have cost a fortune.
Do you have to leave the note?
Including Killaine.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Yes.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
What does he see?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
For five hundred, what do I get?
For two hundred?
A thousand.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
You're not English.
How's life treating you?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
I don't.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
How would you know, Brandon?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
I don't think you locked your door.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
With what motive?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Go live in a tent.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
I think so.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Positive?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
How about Magruder?
I'll take your word.
How do you do, sir.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
What are my orders, sir?
Why should I mind?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
That's not very kind.
You already have the checks, darling.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
What a shame.
It's fine, thank you.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Yes.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I'm not sure I can face it.
I see.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
Thank you.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
And you're at this third stage
You just might.
I might.
That'll be fun
Why not.
I know.  I'm sorry.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
It's shit.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Oh yes.
Ha ha...
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Yes, finally.
Have you come to talk about me?
All right.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
No.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
She said that?
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Not yet.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
My man!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Not so far.
That's the point, isn't it?
What that?
The shit they pull, huh?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Thanks, buddy.
Okay, Dad.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Right here, partner.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Nothing.
Shrimp and fries.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Catch of the day.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Something... in the trees...
This gets better by the minute.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We're going to need everyone.
You know you can't win this one.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
The best friend I ever had.
There's something else, Major...
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Twenty-five percent.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Yes.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sure.  For five bucks.
The price just went up to ten.
Sit... and spin.
Do you plan everything?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that's you.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
I sell them.
All right, two thousand.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are you taking me!?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
No.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Yes...
Why?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I pray for that.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Rent.  You're late.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I leave extras, miss.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
But what if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Yeah.  Thanks.
So it's to be torture.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
I do not marry tonight.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
And what am I?
As you wish.
As you wish.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Gently.
It never happened.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Yes, some of the time. 
How many could you handle?
The body?
Right, right, sorry.
What is it?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
You want me to read this or not?
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Are you a rotten liar.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Thank you.
Then why are you smiling?
You know what a hurry we're in.
Morons.
Good. Then pour the wine.
I smell nothing.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I will. And I choose --
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
A good hour. Yeah.
Have fun storming the castle.
"Honeymoon,
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
I already have.  Come on.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
No.  We go. 
Oh, the best one.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
I told them we invaded England.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
What?
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
Tell me all about her.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
Someone is sitting in that window.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
What?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
All right.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Like what?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Lila.
Huh?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Well?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Of course we will.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
Hospital clean.
I could stand something regular.
I have to go, Sam.
No.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I'm thinking of it.
Don't miss your plane.
Los Angeles.
No.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I'd like to, but...
Then I'm free to go...?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
He's already been.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Yes.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Who are you? What is your name?
Maybe you want my money, too.
I don't know--I can't tell--
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
Yes!
A voice ...
Yes, the child ...
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
Delighted, I'm sure. 
I'm not quarreling, only ...
So that's the way it is?
Thank you.
I'd love to, at any time.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
What do you think I am?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
You give me a pain!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Who'd steal her body?
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You're insane.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Yes.
Yes....
Day or night?
It's an experiment.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I don't want to know...
What are you going to do, Rose?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Okay.
At least.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
I think we both know her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Yes, sir.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Oh, yeah?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
Be quiet, Rose.
It'll get better now.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Fair enough.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
Stop blaming yourself.
I got him.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
It's not gonna happen.
Wha... ?
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
Can't you say something nice once?
I'm waiting till the time's right.
There probably is.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
You can't be serious.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know... you could say thank you.
Slow down.
Don't crowd him.
No you're not.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Whatever goes bang.
Out here.  On your knees.
Dead.
I'm well aware of that.
Billy!  Billy!
All right. Stand by.
Yoda will always be with you.
But I have no sister.
I can't see.
Where am I?
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Fine. Together again, huh?
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
You, too.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
We shall double our efforts.
Red Leader standing by.
Your Royal Highness.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I will not fight you, father.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Yes.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
I've got something to say.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
No, don't do that.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Absolutely.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
...I suppose.
Morning after?
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I sold them to you.
Yes, I do.
It's fine.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
What?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Don't want weak legs.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
Yeah...
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
I gotta go out for a while.
What're we going to do?
Christ.
Paulie!
It's not your house --
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
One more round.
...It's very American.
Fouls.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Does that bum have to say that?
No dollar.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
I agree.
What's happenin' here?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Yeah.
Gonna try.
No action.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Hey --
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
...Yeah.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
...What?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah, Kayo.
Spider Rice.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Yeah, sure.
Message -- What message?
Yeah.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
I got pain an' experience too.
I never had good footwork.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Real good.
What?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Let's get outta this stink.
...Sure.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Whatta you think?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Well, I'll be...
So where is it then?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Sounds like singin'.
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Uh? Uh?
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Then I'll leave thee.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why, what is Tybalt?
By my head here come the Capulets.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Welcome.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Well, what was yours?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
I thought all for the best.
NO! Mercutio!
What wouldst thou have with me?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Who the fuck are you?
And who are you?
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
How do we know that?
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
You were a soldier, were you?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I don't have it with me...
A post office box.
That's it.
But first you have something to take care of?
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
You seem one to me.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Why don't you go do better, then...
Eat shit and die slowly...
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I do.
So is the woman.
I just wanted to see something.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
You don't have to do this.
It's my job.
Dark ops?
Very ugly.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Business keeps you on the road?
Just like that?
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Why didn't you kill him?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I want to get some hounds down here.
I don't know what you're -
Sure thing, and --
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
We'll figure something out.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
At the expense of six people.
What's that?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
Has he?
I'm in here.
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
Great...
I know.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
I love you Sally.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Could it have been this?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
This just might be our ticket!
What are you getting at?
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Did you say After Midnight?
Is this marked money, or what?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Anything...specific?
Hmmm...
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
So be here at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Yeah.
And what happened?
So...what's the good news?
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, sir.
How much is that?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Is this about the funny money?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
This is a very dangerous man.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
She never even looked at you.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
No.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Who's Benjamin?
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I did!
Carter...
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
Yes.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Any leads?
The Secret Service?  Why?
Did you tell Sterling?
Yes, Master.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
They asked for the best street man I had.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I was being polite.
No.
Did you make the plate?!
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stooly.
Come on!
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yeah, it's good.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
No...what?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
It's called a dress.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Nobody touches me.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Ambassador Han.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
She's fine.
Carter, can I have a moment?
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Then you'll be my best man.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
We'll see.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Really.
Seven-fifty.
Highly suspect.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
You don't know.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Of course.
No.  You take it.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Excuse me?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I'd rather not.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Yup!
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
No.  It's my life.
No, you tell her.
You don't love me, is that it?
-- who's married to --
I love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
What is it?
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
What?
You couldn't.
About what?
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I should say something in this about magic.
"I want to meet you..."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Listen to this, I love this part --
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
M.F.E.O.?
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
A sense of humor.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I know. 
Yes.
What?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
Yes, I did.
It's me?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Have you had any relationship since?
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Yeah.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Seventy... eight.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
You think so?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
I don't think I have to now.
My feelings exactly.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
P.  Dad?
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
What?
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Okay.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
No.
Sure.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Well...
Hi.  Sam?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's good at it.
I read the same article...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
No thanks.
That's none of their affair.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
What's more important than sanitation?
What has it got me, your union?
I'm a fool.
What makes you so sure?
Can be what?
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
You mean Delaware?
You've got to help around the house!
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
No.
I was talking to my wife.
Shhh.
Not even a guess?
How about in the house?
First rate, ain't it?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Leave me out of this.
Colette ...
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
How?
Like you?
And you admire that?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You really need to lighten up.
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
Ass first into the world.
Why?
I don't want to leave you.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Can your man handle that?
Can you set that up?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
I don't trust anybody.
What does that mean?
Crank or glass?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
If you say so.
What?!
Yeah.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Just some buddies.
You go, boy.
Tell me what?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Jesus.
My name is Tom.
Yeah.  What about him?
To who?
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
They have. But they never found a lab.
You mean the menacing red car?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
What is it, drugs?
I thought you were done.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Spit it out, Captain.
In West Fork?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Shut up, will you?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
I guess.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Keep trying.
To each, his own.
White-walls?
Senator's son?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Where are you from, Captain?
I don't expect to live that long.
But, sir...
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about Talbot?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Is it getting worse?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Let's just find someplace.
Yeah.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I know.
You're welcome, John.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's always a bright side.
Ours is not to reason why.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
We can't leave it here.
But we accomplish the mission.
That's a mystery to me.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Have it your way, Captain.
I coach the baseball team, too.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Alright, come with me.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
What are we likely to run into?
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
I can accept that.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I love you dad.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I like him a lot.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Yes, I...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
You're right.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Hi.  You called me?
Pardon me?
Goodbye.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Bye.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah.
Then why are you shaking?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
No, no.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
Oh shit.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
No.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Fine Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Very talented.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
So what's up?
Your car?
What?
Yeah.
I called her up.
Alright!
I love you too.
Yeah, alright.
Oskar, please -
It's up to you.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
True.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
I pay you too much.
What's going on?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great, thanks.
Nice things cost money.
She's good.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Pistols?
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
The war could end.
Are you losing money?
What other point is -
Yes.
Stern.
They're withholding payment.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
Would it do any good?
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
That doesn't work, sir.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
What is it?
Where?
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
I'm inquisitive.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Did it?
It’s over, Cotton.
Did you do it?
You have a right to be angry.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
Not one bit.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
The forbidden subject.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Or it found us.
Tuition’s expensive.
I see you read the book.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
Can we turn the light on?
Over here.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
Don't worry...
I'm everywhere.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Is Sid in therapy?
Gotta.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Thanks, Joel.
But...
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
But she's standing right next to you.
Shush.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
I don't know.
Do I?
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Always.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Who is it?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
But you know who she was.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
What the hell are you doing?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
Let's get out of here!
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
W-what do you want?
How do I know their voices are --
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
No one's saying you did.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
You know it.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
She looked dead. Still does.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
It's okay. We need to talk.
Oh Sidney...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
What?
Stop it!
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Who is this?
What number is this?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
To apologize.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
No...
NOOO!
Come on. It'll be fun.
YES!
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
Can I bring Kenny?
I don't think you're so bad.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
...yeah...
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
What were you doing out here?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Yes, sir.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
You want to go live?
Yes, that's right.
Forget it.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
And why would she do that?
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
So where are you?
That's the original part.
Uh-huh.
No you didn't.
She's the Scream Queen.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
Like you had one.
I'll be right back.
How do you gut someone?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Later.
I'm not worried.
He was there, Tatum.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Oh, god...
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
Tits -- see.
What am I? The beer wench?
I thought you might want to be filled in.
What are you talking about?
Where was the girl?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
You'll see.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
And, why is that?
It's close.
Shut up!
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I realize that.
For now.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
Guessing at this point is useless.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
What?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
I know.
Just wait!
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Call an ambulance.
Oh, it's alright.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Yes we do.  Here...
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
I don't.  Neither do you.
It's not what you think it is.
I'm fine.
We had him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Kiss me on the lips.
I... I don't understand.
I don't see anything.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
It's a hard place.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Did the wife confess?
I don't know.
How should I know?
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
Why don't you finish the job?
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
Dunno...Seems so.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
By what you preach...none!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
Just keep goin'...
How far's the river from here, Mose?
How many, would you say?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
I'm Clayton.
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Leggo...
Good night...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
He just couldn't wait...
Scar?
What?
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Over there!
We won't be here...Come on!
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
From the beginning...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
You'll never get away from me!
It still worked in town.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
It's good.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Writer, is he?
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Ask him.
See you in jail.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
On my mother's side the Ardens
Who is that?
Yes, I saw it.
A share of the profits.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
How goes it, Will?
Good title.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
When the Queen commands it.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Verona again.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
I have lost my gift.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Oh. What is your name?
Who is there?
A lowly player.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Mr. Henslowe?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
How does it?
You flatter, my lord.
Virginia?!
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Juliet?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
But not quite.
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
I want to talk now.
Now.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Your friends.
I beg your pardon?
Where do you think you'll go?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Cover it?
This is just an informal discussion.
Well, then?
What?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes.
Yes.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
She hated you --
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Yeah.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
So I gathered.
David?
Yes.
Did what?
What? What's wrong?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
OK.
No, no, it's different.
It tastes different.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Forget it.
Where he can't get it?
No.
It's the only way.
That's what I thought he said.
No.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
What?
What about?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
With a face like this?
It was on the television.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Sorry?
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
It's a breeze.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Who?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
What are you talking about?
My keys.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I gotta talk to you.
What kind of treatment?
I hope she's all right.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Right now, I just don't care.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Nobody can hear it.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
It isn't?
Okay.
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
I never get my hair done.
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not like my mother!
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
Oh fuck, Norman!
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
He's a very private person, actually.
I'd cut it...
Yeah, I think so...
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Do you? You still see him?
Yeah?
You did, didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
Yeah, baby...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Jackie, can we --
-- what?
Sammy's?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Nothing.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- please, please forgive me...
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What's gonna happen?
George, I don't --
Keep moving --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
How?
I am?
Great.
Hello.
How did it go at the bank?
Could I?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
I want your feelings about it.
Who?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
-- go ahead.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
What is.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Yes it is.
In a way. But...
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Sure.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
Well, what?
What can I say!
What, do you think I planned it?
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
Okay, thanks.
Who?
I'll call you back.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Is that right?
Fine.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Don't be silly.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
That's right.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Sure.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
That's fine --
Jill.
Have they sat down?
-- we're going to be here all night.
Where to, Les?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Dad?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tell you things?
Try to think what it was.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
All right.
Okay...oh!
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Why not?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
That's right, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Hmm, nice.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Why?
Why?
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Give me the bat.
Yes?
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well...
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, it's very... homely.
Oh, I'll say.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
No.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
But Uncle Al! You said-
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Oh?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Oh-huh.
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Chops?
Am I?
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
Pay attention...
Enough jabber.
You know that song?
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
You re okay -- for a civilian.
I... I brought you something.
She won't?  Why not?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Experience!  Right?
Honey.
It's true!
Your name?
What?
You mean black people?
What's a concubine?
I'm outta here.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Come, Sister.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Out of the question.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have a phone call.
Oh?
I'm a Christian.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
He didn't do you a favor.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I think they'd understand.
Even nuns have to pee.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Oh-huh.
Who are you guys?
Maybe. 
Maybe pants.
Which one!
Which one?
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
That's what I figured, too.
We're losing it.
Really...
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
However, we can also pray for other things.
Which convent was that, Sister?
That was exciting!
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
But how do we get there?
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
... Brom Bones...
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Pardon me?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
I shall, gladly.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Believe?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
How could he?
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Should we go back?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Tired.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
There is no such thing as magic.
They have done nothing of the sort.
To avenge his father, and the others.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
His horse.
No.  She has gone out.
What did you say?
Father saw you die.
No.
I can't remember.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that's good to eat?
What you got in there, warshing?
They was a boy. We made friends.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
It went real good.
No sir.
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I thought I told you to keep out!
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Childers.
I aim to kill you with it.
I reckon I feel all right.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
All right then.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Why did he do that, reckon.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Naw.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I don't reckon I know.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Is that right?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
Yeah.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I reckon.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
All right then.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Why?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Actually, I'm his father.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Huh?
What's the difference?
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
He's crazy.
Not a peep.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
I mean, it's a good story.
You're looking good, Auggie.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
Thanks for the tip.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Those are pretty hostile words.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Not a one.
It was just a thought.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
What do you want me to say?
Baby? And what baby is that?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
He's dead?
What time is it?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yeah, I picked it up.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That money is my whole future.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Medium rare, please.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
You don't.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Well, what if?
Why?  We're only talking.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Oh, in a heartbeat.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Tht was summation, Your H...
He didn't want to lose any more.
Carl Heine came.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
I should show them an American?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
I already said that, b...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Carl never lied.
All right, girls - from the top again.
Fresh!

What did he say?
Those two musicians from the garage!
No we're not.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
We're not too late, are we?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
As far away as possible.
Shave our legs, stupid.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
And I'm Daphne.
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Tore off one of my chests.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Good night, Josephine.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
But this is so humiliating.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Don't get burned, Daphne.
He's going to be ashore with you.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I am.
Security.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Like right after the ceremony.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Shut up and keep packing.
Get me Room 414.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
Stay as long as you'd like.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
What did you say?
I'm fine.
I may spill something.
What's the surprise?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
What's that?
Vanity Fair?
Well, I'll come back later.
I hope so.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Yes.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Help yourself.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
We won't breathe a word.
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
William Morris!
No - funerals.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Oh.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Every time!
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Glasses?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Good night, Sugar.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
My fault.
I don't think so.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
They repealed Prohibition?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
They just sort of leave me cold.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, no!
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
I knew you would.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Booze.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
I never join nothin'.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Why?
You and who else?
I already told you.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
You don't owe me no nothing.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Except it’s Scotch.
Still--
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Mom, please.
I had to say something to get you here.
Yeah, kind of.
What?
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
No, tell me.
Hello, Katmandu.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
It’s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It’s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don’t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Shampoo, got it!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Make out with you for free.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
I haven’t thought about that in years.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
That's right--
That's where we come from first?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
She was dirty and wet...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
Here, put my jacket over you.
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Where was you, Daddy?
What happened afta that?
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
September 4 -- how far away is that?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
Yes mam...
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
David, come back here!
Yes, mam...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Yes, ma'm...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'll walk...
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
Tired.
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
Is there something I can do to help you?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Will they give him a trial?
Behold my glory.
There are more important matters right now...
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Doggy.
Pillow.
Fragile?
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Very funny!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
And she's getting worse...
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
What Cartman?!
Whoops.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Hey, Chef.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
MPH RM!!!
Mph rm.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Yeah, I guess.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Kay.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Kyle, check it out.
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
How do we do that?
What's the difference?
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Me?!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Are you sure, Kenny?
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Terrance! NO!
I know.
No! It can't be!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Oh Sara...
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
That's me.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Will you shut up already?
That's right.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Just considering our options... sir.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Yeah?
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Why?  Where are you going?
You too.
Taylor!  Where are you?
We have room!  Let's go!
Marry you?
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
The engines!
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
That's affirmative.
Nope.
He's my dad.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
It was a clearance.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
That game was before you was born.
She's my mom.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I'm your blood.
I gotta survive.
I am underground.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Hello, mom?
Cool!
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Someone wants to play with me?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
What ever happened to just bowling?
How Mr. Kastle?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Coming right up.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Nothing.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
More than you could afford.
I could let them go for ten.
It's Junior, isn't it.
It?
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
I can't...
I said back away.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Forty yards.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
He's right beneath us.
Captain.
What team?
They didn't tell me anything.
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
What do you mean, he's missing?
When was this?
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
What?
The what?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What's inside the sphere.
Too big?
I love secrets.
What -- are you threatening me?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
You went through Edmunds' things?
He what?
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
Squids?
But why is he doing it?
Valdomet.
Tarazine?
Bingo.
Antibiotic.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How fast does it take effect?
For what?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
By the bunks.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
Just in time for what?
We can refuse to talk.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
I'm not being defensive.
I'm fine.
Wait a second, I --
To what?
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What noise?
That far in what, Harry?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
I thought she was with you.
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
I don't think so.
Hold on.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Wait!
You mean forget?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Meaning?
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
"We are friends".
Does this mean what I think it means?
No, they didn't say --
Told me what?
Please, Ted.
Four.  Four years --
I don't know.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
This isn't a game, you know.
Is that good or bad?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
You mean I generate an energy field?
That's where my father was killed.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
He can't find Organa Major.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Send one squad up.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Why didn't you say so before.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
He'll be well cared for.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I read you sir.
It's what I deserve.
YAAAAAAAA !
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Funny...
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Good luck at the academy.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Alright, I love you.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
How are you, Carl ?
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Guess you gotta go.
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Sir, yes, sir !
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hi, mom.
Yeah, that's right.
Move out.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
What is it, Rico ?
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
Give'em hell, sir !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
To join with him.
You may proceede.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
By the Creator.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Viewer, standard ahead.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Hold relative position here...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
To you, sir?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
You bet your life.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
It's in your play.
It's about life.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
It was either that, or a sardine.
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You'd know better'n me.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
I thought you had Play Practice.
What?
Better idea...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
Oh, God...
I used to go out with a politician.
It used to be the Old Mill.
<u>Please</u>...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Going home.
Sleep well?
Not without a rolltop desk.
What is it, a surprise?
That's so beautiful...
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Hi.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
This horse is booked.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
She wasn't in the...
What'll I do for fun?
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
We've got three days to...
What...
I've always seen that.
I'm ready!
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Thank you.
I wasn't in the car.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I, actually yes.
Why?
But we...
Who is that...?
I...
I just...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Is...Is the Movie!
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
I know, I know.
The minute I read that script I said...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
This young woman.
Later for you, pal.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
Sure.
You bet he did.
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I'm gonna nail it.
I have to tell the truth.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
If you do the product placement...
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Mmm...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I hate when you say that.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Sex.  Of course.
During sex.
...why do you think?
What are you gonna talk about?
I'll be there for you.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Like a big sister.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Maybe twenty.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Yes.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
And this is my room so get out!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Ice cold water.
There's worse things.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
I have lava.
You have the WORST flu since...
Rache says it's from you.
You dying.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
You think I didn't get that?
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
You're WHERE?
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Just not to me.
WE are over.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
We're going to win this.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
But it's not on the schedule!
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
Nobody likes a snoop.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
See, I know that.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Brad Kovitsky.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Don't be too sure.
Give 'em my number.
Worked.  Like a charm.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You weren't passing 'em out.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
What do I have that you don't?
You're the hip and fresh.
I have their past.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
So I'll have to order in?
Jesus.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Thank you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes, Mikey?
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God's will.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
No.
He's dead.
He wasn't.
Yes, I do. I love them!
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
You started filling out your college applications yet?
What's tomorrow?
Oh. What happens now?
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
I'm going in there.
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Hi, Dad!
'Fuck me hard!'
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
So where'd you get in?
He did?
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What do you think?
Yeah?...
Used to Filmore, used to.
There's the fence...
Because I'll be firing at them.
Well Cooper...
I guess not Cooper...
Are you going to kill us?
He's in there...
She's as good as gone...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
What the hell is it, anyhow?
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
If I don't get power up we are!
What does that mean?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
What is your name, young lady?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.
That's right, sir.
You're right, sir.
Plan-R????
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
I presume the planes are armed?
Why can't you cancel it?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
What?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Speed?
They're moving apart.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Very interesting.
I've got one.
Quentin, how's your gear?
What are you talking about?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Typical male.
Hey, you said you did a video?
What's it about?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
So you can do an album cover?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I mean, no one.
Look.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Sure I am. It's fun.
Shit.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Are you talking to me?
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Oh, you were there?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Yeah.
It's nice here. It's different.
Hi.
Mm.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
You cut off your little finger?
Yeah?
We were?
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
It does look good.
Who were you talking to?
Ask your girlfriend.
No.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
You don't know?
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
That, that's Indian?
Is that Bee-Bee?
That's right.
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
I hate that.
No.
Man?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
I would've stopped it.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
And?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
No, no.
I don't know.
Mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
You do.
I, yeah.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Well, not exactly.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Oh, yeah.
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
Well, what about this?
Camel jockey.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Yeah.
You done?
You do?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
If you hit me...
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Hey, Tim.
Come on, Jeff.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Sorry, Kansas...
You just became a statistic!
It's twins!!
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
No...I've been pregnant.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
And they get caught!
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Y'think?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Well, I want to know what happened --
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
We were told you could "fix us up."
That you?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Close, but no cigar.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Nothing for Ladd?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Why, you sweet kid.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Well, for heaven's sake!
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
We're engaged.
Nobody can be that busy.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
It must be my new shampoo.
Twenty-two.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
You did.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
This is where you live?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
It is not.  Get out.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Uh-huh.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
This is the right day.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
Yes, Norma.
I think I'll read a little.
I went for a walk.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Is that So?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
No?
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Yes, Madame.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But which one?
Sorry, mistress.
It's what we were warned about.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
I have to.
Who didn't?
You love me?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Just like that?
But why?
Miss what?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I'll drink to that.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
I don't want your help.
You vicious--
I've got things to do.
Can I quote you?
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
The scoop of the year!
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
It was just a trim.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'm Linda Lee.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Cigarette?
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Not yet.
For what?
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
I know.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
I seem to be.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
The kid needs a man to show him --
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
Who?
Oh...I came close once.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, thanks.
Uh-huh.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
What's that?
Gus Gorman.
I know, I'm the fault.
Yeah. A raise . .
Uh...
Columbia.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
That what they call you?
What are you talking about, fella?
KRYPTONITE!
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Fair's fair.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
Just a second.
Sister! I'm his sister!
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Anytime.
We've already met.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Tell me.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Gus?
In other words, push this red button.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
What's wrong?
A normal person.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
She'll be fine.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Lois, you're amazing.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
What??
We'd better talk.
Let's get you inside . . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
What else is ballast for?
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Wrong.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
My kind of people.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
We must combine our strength.
I really don't think . . .
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Don't worry, I've got you.
If you say so. Here goes.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
. . . Let me get my purse.
Clark. . . !
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Absolutely!
Go on . . .
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
. . . And  very naïve!
Who?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Something . . . wonderful.
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
What?
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
First, I have fun.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
It was hot, yes.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
He may have a gun!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Huh?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Jealous? Of what?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
First the pets, Otis.
You're on.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Ready.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Gets you where you live, huh?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
He sure as heck does that.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
He'll be weightless.
You've got me? Who's got you???
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I guess they are a little odd.
It's not bad.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
I'll tell her that.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Goodnight, Nicole.
How?
C'mon, you know that won't...
Billy, that's too early.
And they loved Bear.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
That would complicate things.
I did.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
Isn't it a lovely day?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Yes.  It's a present.
Did he say what about?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
You hate that.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I won't lie.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Was the bus on time?
And what was the weather like at this time?
Will you be spending more than a night?
There's the Prescots...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Crafts?
Yes.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
No.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Yes.
You remember that much?
Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
The ramp?
As opposed to this T.V.?
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
I don't know.
But Charlene...
Thanks, I see him...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Hurry back.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Who said Sidney?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Not just this minute, J.J....
You print them, don't you?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
When?
Get Steve back his job...please...
No, I won't...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Can't hurt...
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
You're incapable of the truth...
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
What about?
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
At the bar - Sidney...
In his apartment -
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I'm used to you...
Nothing...
Yes.
That's no way to talk...
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
What ship?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Max.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
You told me to.
Why?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Chill out, dickwad.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
No problemo.
Dyson.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Unknown.
So do you.
Why him?
Relax now, Sarah --
On all what?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
and totally irrelevant.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
No can do.
I have a duty.
Yes.
Yes.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
That is correct.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
May I ask a question?
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
What?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
That's what I asked.
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Never heard of him, who is he?
Who's he?
You're late.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Great.
We will, kiddo.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
I don't understand...
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Why?
That's not my mission.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
You must have had a fun child-
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
No.  I'm not.
No.  Never.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Why?
Of course.
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I just called.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Oh, no... you.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Don't just stand there, get help!
What... is... happening... ?
It was a gift... from my brother.
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You pull me up.
No.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
I think not.
Is this you?
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Nicholas...
God, wake up, it's a con!
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Nicholas...
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
... what... ?
Stop talking to them!
That's not true...
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I'll call them, okay?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Yes.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
I'm not sure.
I'm just like him.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Look, where is he?!
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
Attempted murder.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Sure.
Just stay there, Nell!
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I got more scared.
It was.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Nell.  You will come here now.
Good.
That?  That's Hill House.
How could you do this to people?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
She was unhappy.
No one will come any nearer than that.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
I don't know what you mean.
That's why we're here.
What's his first name?
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I have a loft.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Sure.
Not bad.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
There's been some trouble downtown.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Round about, yeah.
Huh?
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
That would be too easy.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Not much -- you?
Really.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Been busy, have you.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
How'd you manage that, then.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
He give me your address.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
That's what was estimated.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
My employer.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
I'll bloody well ask him.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Up the coast.
All of what?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
I got half.
Yeah.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
I don't know.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
I don't want you here, Terry.
No trouble.
Susan.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Tell me.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Who?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Boy.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Uh-huh.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Sure.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
No, Dave, I wasn't.
How's business, Dave?
What is it, Dave?
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
I, uh...
Told what?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
You don't have to--
Honey...
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uh-huh.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
Huh? No.
No thanks, I--
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Uh... you're under arrest.
Great.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
I appreciate that.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Call me Vince.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Correct.
The sub-basement?
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
What is it?
Got my hands full here.
Not so loud.
I'd say we're in its home.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
He's right.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Get back!  Now!
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Eats them?
Okay.
Maybe not.
You were going to be married.
A monster?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Gone.
The planetarium!
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
What are you going to do?
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I can't!
One.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's to see?
What have we missed?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Certainly a nomination.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
Oh, yes.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
How about them?
I told you I can't.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
It's a surprise.
I've been thinking--
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
I don't know--
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You hate gambling.
You blaming me for the traffic?
There's been an accident, Truman.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Well, I made it through another night.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
--How do you know about that?
I don't understand.
You can count on it.
Does what?
When was that?
Nothing completely conclusive --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Into what?
What's that?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
What's wrong, Scully?
I'm in the vending room.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
-- of what exactly?!
I have no idea.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think... something stung me.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Thank you.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
How?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Yes mother.
Okay.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Give a kiss to Edward.
You don't know the procedure.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Peter, okay?
Then what is he?
Little boy?!  That's him!
I got it.
He's beautiful...
's broken.
You're kidding me.
I think that's the whole point.
Absolutely.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Dr. Kent.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Completely unaware.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
It's his dog.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Give her some cigarettes.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
They're forged.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Well you read this.
Tell me more.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
I thought you wanted...
We're both in it, Harry.
What are you going to do?
He told you, didn't he?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
I'm sorry.
Oh, the usual things...
Yes.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
It wasn't important.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Yes, of course.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
No.
Best thing that ever happened...
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
You're not locking her up?
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
No.
How about the doorway?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
I said you win.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Goodness, that's awkward.
Certainly.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
You can help her.
And - Anna...
Why not?
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What do you want?
Coffee.
Here?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Vinkel.
I understand...
In great pain?
Yes, sir.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What's he saying?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Who else?
You don't mean that doctor?
Funny?
He didn't want to get involved.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Not when I get interested.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Never.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Traveler.
Good morning.
We moved rooms because of him.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Fuck off.
Eh - bonsoir.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Richard, you know something -
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Why the fuck not?
Why won't you talk to me?
What do you care?
No difference.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
You gotta get out of here.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Notice? Like what...?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Of course they're Jews.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
No.
Get the fuck away from me.
I can't help what I think.
A forty-five.
You're lying.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
You do it on the inside....
Fine.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
What kids?...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Who told you that?
A Jewish prayer.
The mother.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Where?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
JTS...?
Wow, that's uh...great...
I was a Jew in a previous life.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Fund-raising??
Eat shit....
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
But your man isn't quite a God!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
In a lake.
Congratulations.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Don't.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Then tell him to wax it too.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
I didn't say...  Brussels!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
What room have you got?
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
... For the mermaids.
Everything about what?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
... Yes.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
... Okay.  I'll try.
Thank you...
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
It's me again.
... Nothing.
... Are you sure?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Again?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Haven't you been listening?
No.  I'm just depressed.
Of course, that's what they're for.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Let him sleep.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Mazel Tov!
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
A stereo type alarm system?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
That's some cold shit.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
What about me?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
I sleep it off.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Up at the museum.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Good evening.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I want to ask you something.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
More or less.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
I thought they came right past here ——
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
Don't be soft.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
And not a sign of the leopard?
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
I know -- Teresa -—
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Will you please come with me?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
...We’re turning in circles.
Something like that.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Croissants.
Yeah.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I see. How much?
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Should I?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
When... I’m told he came here...
Anything at all?
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
An Austrian.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
No...
I... How long have I been here?
Excuse me?
Could that be Camden Market?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Tu sais où me trouver.
If you can, send me a receipt.
The acid bath?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
They've started the battle without me!
Jeanne, no...
Tell me...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
To marry you.
But it is what I want.
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
Sound the retreat...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
In a village called Domremy.
Silence her!  Take her away...!
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
He's feeling wonderful.
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Noooo!
Go and ask him yourself.
Yes.
Go on to the next question.
God.
The wind will be against us...
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Yes, it's a miracle.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
No... not like this...
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
I -- I -- I...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
Yes!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Oh no?  How about this one?
In His name??
Really?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What are you doing on the wall?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
I need to confess again.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
And what does he say to you?
Why did she have to die?
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Dorota.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
What, I'm working, what?
I haven't seen him.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
It certainly was.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
You'll be deported.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
There are always notices going up.
Can you help? I've no money...
Wladek! How are you?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
No, I don't think so?
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
In the attic.
We're getting out.
To be deaf?
Baines is packing up?
The Alps.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
I'd like to make a swap.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Nothing just yet
No, not words.
They are washed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
What happened?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
That's right.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
What's the line on Visitation?
Billie.  You ready?
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Here.
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
You think my play is bad?
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Forget it.
They workin' for anybody?
Who's got the contract?
What do ya want the others to get?
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
I picked something up on the way.
We'll get by without 'em.
I never played for winos.
If we ever get to it.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
The wire is ten years outa date.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Nice work, J.J.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
But I got a train to make.
Where you goin'?
Yeh, sleepin'.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
All right, when?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I am after this race.
No.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
For fifteen years.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
No.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
You know how they are... sex...
Just a minute...
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Said he stole his invention.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
You've got to get your mind off this.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Now do you believe me!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
What would your mother say to that?
Where are you going?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Better get home before it is.
Not a thing.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
What's he want of you?
I'm asking you.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
What do you mean?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Let him have his say out.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Good.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
No.
Is Julia going with you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Take it easy.
What are you drinking?
Maybe it would if I took it.
They were kidding you.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
I'll get some towels. 
You talk as if I were Asta.
Catch me letting you go alone!
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
I did find him!
That's a fact.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Smart gal.
No.  Nobody but you.
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
No, Mr. Charles.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Oh, God.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
You just go when I say go.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
So we wait.
Maybe I do.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you; don't push me around.
Why'd he come in our camp.
We're at war.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
I have to answer him.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Millionaires, man.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I heard it.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It's a fire fight.
So where do we start?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
Is it all right if I stand up?
You still got a map on you?
Makes two of us.
Damn.
It's got to be going better than this..
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I don't have a weapon.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know!
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Somebody has to.
Thanks.
I don't know.
Really?
He'll slow down.
The photos.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I thought it would be good to know.
Now you need me.
For real?  A treasure?
Naw, nothing.
Like I said; so?
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
Yes!
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
You know what I'm doing with my half?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Oh, Jesus!
Then lets go back while we still can.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
All last night he could have been--
I'm not wasting my water on him.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Correct.  Origin?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Looks like dirt.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
It's 3+27 hundred
No....I though  I'm afraid.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
You don't know.  You don't....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
No!...No!...
I want you for my roommate.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
What?
Look!
That way.
What?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
I'm only trying to help you.
What do you want?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Where are they?
Officer Reilly, vice.
You the Bomb Squad?
Thanks.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
I don't know. You tell me?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Yep.
`Til we get a better lead.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
Your partner?
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Would you?
Me, too.
Right.
Nothing.
Easy, guys.  
We work fast enough for you?
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Taylor's dead.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
What? Nobody, I-
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
Shit. We're fucked.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And diamonds in the front.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
Amsterdam?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Nice suit.
Smart. London, eh?
I thought so.
Yes, Baron.
Um-hum ...
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
What is it?
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
No, thank you.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Seven and nine!
Certainly!
Spanish passports?
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Yes.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
As you like. 
Yes!
This used to be my secretary's room.
You think that's too much?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Um-hum ...
Together.
How do you like my dress?
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
You're conceited--
I know it.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
No--thirty-five! 
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes, Madame Colet?
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Please!  Thank you.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
For all the really important things--
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
I don't want your money!
Yes, my bag!
Well, where is it?
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
I was tired.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
What do I tell your mother?
Can I bum a cigarette?
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Almost as good as you.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Bollocks.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
Excuse me.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
No.
I know what ice fishing is!
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
She had beautiful hands.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
It's okay. I'm alright.
I'll be right back.
It's so cold.
Excuse me.
Goodbye, mother.
How'd you ever get away with it?
Will you leave me alone?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I don't understand.
Where's Lother?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
But--
Sally--!
You said it! How about a little action?
Good night, idiot!
Lose?--I won a little--
I'll be waiting on deck.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Change?
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
I'll take one. 
Partners, ain't we?
Where did you hide it?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Think again--
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Why?
Thanks. That makes us square.
What'll I say?
How?
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Send that.
Next month is June.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
I thought I put you to bed.
That's fine.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Like it?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
Somebody's got to do it--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
The country boy's about due.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Good night!
I sincerely hope so--
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Now Ed, are we cross?
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Come and get him.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Good.  That's real good.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Say when.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
But who was the Devil?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I'll remember you said that.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
How you feelin', Doc?
What?
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
What was that all about?
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
I know.  Me neither.
Colorado's closer
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
How would you know?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Forget it, Ringo.
All right, run 'em off.
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Morg, use your head.
You're on.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Yeah, and dangerous.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
...Words to live by?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
I'm sorry.
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Is that any way to say hello?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Well... If you insist.
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Three. You? Married?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Let's not make it a habit.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Up.
... We have time for that?
Don't say it.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Next time, I do the driving.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Of course.
It doesn't quite add up.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Captain Morton.
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
I see you two have met.
Approaching the first gate.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Yes.
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You always got something to say.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Babe Brother.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
It is just a regular card.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
No, I'm too hot now.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
It's healing now.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Whadda ya think?
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Where was the last place you left him?
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Let's let Molly open one.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
You mean it has hyperdrive?
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
What?!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
I can't see a thing!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Did I get my package in the mail?
She's sick!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Toss 'im overboard!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
I was close to being scared that time.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
He got it, Woody!
Yes SIR!
I can't quite make out -- 
That's right.  Your toys.
But you're Irish!
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I did like the music.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
She got away.
She'll have to learn.
Get away from me...
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
It was only a mouthful!
We're too young.
It's all right, Finn.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Carl --
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Caroline --
Hi.
Sixteen
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Nope.
She ain't in on it.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
I don't know.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
No --
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
Yeah.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
We agree.
An informant.
What is it you want me to do?
But will he be house-trained?
Any idea how much?
Any way we can do it better?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I don't know what to say.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Did you bring the cards?
Thanks.
Ssshh!
Shut up.
Out.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
And don't make any noise.
Because it's illegal.
No, not holding hands.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
So why have you told me about it?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Sixteen next month.
Fuck, OK.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Sorry about last night -
No.
No.
Aye.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
No, I'm clean.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Yeah.
Right.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Despite the Academy award?
Give me the gun.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
What?
He made me lick it.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Your favourite dish.
Yeah.
Six weeks.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
That's fair enough.
Went ballistic?
So what's it going to be?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
He doubts me.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
My pain?
Pavel.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Raise shields.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Goodnight, Bones.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is what possible?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
That's a little vague, Spock -
A "t."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
You call that getting over it?
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
If you think -
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I... have come to communicate with my User.
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Wrote the...?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Why? What are you going to do?
Shhhhh.
Recognizers!
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
End of line.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
That's all going to change, Yori...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
Why is everything...like this?
Then I owe you some thanks...
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I'm shocked.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Roger, One.  Rolling.
No way.  Not Dana.
Will you just open the door!					*
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Yeah, but for who?							*
The purse is still at the house.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
Sorry.
I wasn't cheating!
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Yes.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yup.										*
Dance?
Absolutely.
So what's your angle?
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Those idiots.
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
I just glances inside.
He wants to speak with you.
Knock wood.
This is great, we got cable.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
The letter he sent.
Now hang up.
And here we are.
Want some Goobers?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
I took a cab.
Would you like to get some pie?
There's nothing to tell.
What's your favorite movie star?
Very much. Now, where were we?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
At the movies?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Really?
How come?
That rhymes.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
I don't blame you.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
No thanks.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Tomorrow.
Has he gotten his mail today?
You goin' out?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Every word of it.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I certainly hope so.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Where?
Two guys.
Let me handle this.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
In case.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Want an animal cracker?
Look, Dick, I don't -
The police department?
He trusts you?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
I guess so. Follow me.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
We grew up together.
I bullshitted him.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
She seems very nice.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
I'm your son.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Uh-huh.
What about him?
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Where'd you come from?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Uh-huh.
I believe he believes him.
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Rock whores.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
No.
Read my lips.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
I didn't mean -
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
And your only goal is...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
It's so clean.  No germs.
This is April, right?
No, 1995 is the past.
No more drugs.  Please...
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
It's private.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You can't do that yourself?
I said I was sorry.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Think you'll live that long?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Hundred and eight already.
I don't care, just get me there.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yep.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What?
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
I want my car.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
John . . .
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
What do you want?
John--
Sheriff Potter.
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
There's someone in the house.
What does it look like?
I don't know your real name.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
What?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have ideas.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You know what I want.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
How much money has he got?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
What about us?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What about him?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
But I want to say with you,
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
John Stewart.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
How do you know if you've never tried?
I do.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
How do you put a price on murder?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Do we shake hands?
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Is the job done?
Liar.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Christ, Jake, please--
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
What?
You're too quick for me.
Stand up.
Oh, shit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
I guess.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Sure, Sheriff.
What for?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
All right, old man.  Christ.
That's 'cause he's dead.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Who's cursed?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You expect me to believe that?
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Would I what?
How do you know if you've never tried?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You came to take my wife from me?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Nope.  Darrell.
Darrell--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What sign?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
Open up!
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
Eh?
No! No police.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
What happened to your hand?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
Those are white words, not ours.
Come here.
Yeah.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
But I thought --
What are you talking about?
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
The ticket is 30.55.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Sure, I'll try.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Oh?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
No! No! Please!
You didn't hear something?
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Yes.
No that's it.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes. Is this David?
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Think carefully?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know Megan.
We've already begun.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
But not a knife?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
One last question.
That's not what I witnessed David.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
We are.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
I see.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
And what was that explanation?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
We was... lyin'.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Your wife?
Be careful with those, sonny.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Oh yeah.
Alive?
No?
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Yup.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Shut up, Kid.
You better get on back, Miss.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Huh?
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
Beats the hell out of me.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
How far kin you see?
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Tom?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Did I what?
What?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
See that scrub oak yonder?
He's blind, for Chri...
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
They'll never stop.
Umm ...
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
Dig.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Well, I'm sorry.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Kobayashi.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I just want to hear your story.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Why didn't you say anything?
I never heard of him.
He wanted me to live.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
You thought it was just.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
And no one will know the truth.
I was her doctor.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
...We did everything we could...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Just as you are, Sir...
I'm just an M.D.
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I...yes.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
I completely understand ...
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
No, you did fine.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Right.  Who called?
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors killed her.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
I understand.
Nothing happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Why is that?
...things change.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Missus...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
And what are you?  A cop?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Who told you that?
You, you don't under...
What is that to you...?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Don't touch anything.
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
The Doctors.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
We got to talk.
I don't know.
It's locked.
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
I did.
Thanks, Franky.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes, that's correct.
The Big Boy did...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I married into it.
Almost a year.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Well?
But you knew about this.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
What about?
You're not far wrong.
You won't have to.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
I want to know who you are.
Dinner... and what else?
Because I remind you of her?
Tomorrow morning.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Why?!
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
They're none of them right.
Judy --
No, Ernie's is fine.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No! Let me go!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I loved you, Madeleine.
No...
This afternoon.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
I... didn't know where you lived.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
What?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
I enjoyed talking to you.
Well... anywhere in particular?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No!
What?!
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
No... it's in shadow.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Too late... there's something I must do...
Let me go.
Please answer my question.
What is her name?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Would you please go and look?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
What a pleasant hobby.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
That!?!
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Nothing to tell.
You haven't told me everything.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Wandering.
Can we have it by tonight?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
What?
Multiple reasons.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
I'm not getting a ticket.
You want to hear me out?
Calling the ambulance.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Sure, why not.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
What does that mean?
Watch the tone fella.
At the seven-eleven.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I don't give a damn.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Later.
What happened? Oh my God...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Well, oh...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
So who's the lucky guy?
She's still working?
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Not tonight.
What is her disposition?
Who's up for making some real money?
Shut up.
Shut up.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Nobody knows.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
It's my fucking opinion.
You have a King fantasy.
Goosed!
What?
We missed the deadline.
I don't think so.
Sent it.
I think so.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Right before the wedding?
He's a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Why? What's his problem?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
I've seen it on television.
I will.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
I'm mad at you.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Okay.
I'm working on it.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
We're not canceling.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
But...
But...
What does that mean?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
You're not breathing right?
At the newsstand on 3rd.
My God...
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
...embarrassing, shameful...
That's right.
No, the children sleep with me.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Don't you ever see him?
Evil.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Fifteen yards.
And in the vegetable plot?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Why?
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Do they worry you that much, then?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
She's left.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Where?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Catch him and your record's clean.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
If you can catch him.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Where's my gun?
You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
How do you kill it?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Talk so I can understand.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
That's not true, Parker.
What you need is a collar.
It wasn't a lie.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Enjoying yourself?
Start of what?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Thanks.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You don't know?
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Why's that?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
What are you talking about?
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand...

Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Who're you working for?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
To preserve their Way of Life.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?

Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
All the greater accomplishment.

Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Of what?
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
Watch me.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Yes. 
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Show some compassion.
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
...gotta read my reports.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
What'd you tell him?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Oh yes, I remember you.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
And what do you want?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Thank you
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
They seemed, closing by much 
Vell.  Goodnight.
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
A little?
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
You guys are being real assholes
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
No, he wouldn't.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Fine.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
I'm not...
I've never even met you.
Very much.
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Claire.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
I came in from my room...
Stop.
Good.  I'm good.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
What?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
M-E...
Jody, she's alive.
Did I?
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Relieved?
All of us.
I know.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I think three...
Don't.
It's Saturday.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Nice.  Almost done.
Fine.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
You are...
Nope.
Yup.
Shhh.
More or less.
To make sure she's all right.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Well, that's nice.
Oh, no...
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
...Don't get all...
Well, that's a relief.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Then where is she?
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Stop...
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
We don't know that for sure.
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
Huh.
You don't have to do that.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
MADISON!
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Well, they are.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
But you've not told Michael.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
I had you sent away.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Better than most, I suppose.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Lie...?
Like this...?
I love Michael...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Leave me alone!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
I know.    you are my son -
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
The one time I want it to work...
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Rowan...
You still feel that crazy...?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
- a witch.
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
A little wine...?
Did you see the old man on the ---
I don't know.
What were you talking about...?
You bastard!
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
You can't just -
Papers...?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
That's right...
No - not all the time - I mean
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
The touch?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
Where do you kill them...
I don't know...
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Did you?
I am sorry...
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
At 2.00...
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Astronomical.
Maybe he got promoted.
Perv.
Dead?
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
I love those springy head puppies!
God, I love being dead.
We reinvented ourselves.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You have changed since second grade.
We own a small family grocery store.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Well, why should I?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
...not the pit.
Just say it, Dad.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Hi ho, Silver.
Whatever you want.
What do you want me to do?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Me-ow.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Your article sucked.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
I doubt it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Well? Where the hell are you?
That's refreshingly deviant.
I'm very aural.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
That's hard to believe.
Yellow pages?
You better.
Oh. Goodness.
Like what?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Rules are rules.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
Really? You'd do that for me?
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
What kind of ideas?
Really? So I'm doing OK?
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
He was large?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Suzie?
Back to the land of grownups.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Unless what?
You could say that.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Did he come in with you?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Yeah... okay... he did
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
No!
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Nothing.
Curiosity, I guess.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Whichever one I want.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Where, the mall?
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
So you got my mom's money.
Do it to ourselves?
You know what it takes.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You think that's wise?
What's that supposed to mean?
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Will they?
You got something against cigarettes?
About what?
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
The one you bought at school.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Sit down, Lombardo.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Are you mad at me?
That was the same thing Ray said.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
We?
Shit. Here we go again.
Wouldn't dream of it.
I'll work on it.
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
Relax.  We're almost there.
What?  President Grant is...!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Of course not.
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Yes, me!
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Yes sir.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Dr. Loveless?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
No.  I mean yes.
Why not?
You're not a woman.
Madmartigan.
I will!  But I need help!
Because she's sick.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
I won't.
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Want me to carry Elora?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Burn it to a fine ash.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Shhhhh!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Me neither!
Shut up.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
Not one this big.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Yes, sir.
Sure have, Sam.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
I was wrong.
Only the elders.
Hochmut?
I know what he said.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
I hear you.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Wrong.
I admit I don't know where he is.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Yes.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I know.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
I have committed no sin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If she...
Is morally, ethic'ly
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
This?
Are you all right, Dorothy?
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
How did you guess?
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Stop her!
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh...
All hollow.  Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Not nobody, not nohow!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Huh?  What'd he say?
Did they hurtcha?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Where's Kansas?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh --
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Yeah. Me?
This way!  Come on!
Yeah!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Yeah --
Don't push!
Not nohow!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
We do.
To Oz!
Oh - look out.
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
You promised us real things -- a real...
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
With this?
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
We can’t.
I could come for a second opinion?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I was the one who brought that money in...
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
No. You’ll be safe here.
You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
No!  Get me out!
Your father...
Someone will come.
Is it?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
God isn't there to do it.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.

Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
His . . . whatever.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Yes you are.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Isn't it true that you --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
We're not after car thieves here.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Yes it does.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
Naturally.
Go to hell.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
When can I see you again?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Let me.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Nice place to start, don't you think?
They come in any other styles or colors?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
... until he found tungsten.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
For what purpose?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
What's that?
Into the Hudson?
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
I've seen a lot of rings.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Gosh, I hope so.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Deal.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
A piece.  Only a piece.
It does indeed, Max.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
No!
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Hello...?
Of course.
I promise.
You're incorrigible!
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is it worth taking a chance?
It seems fine.
Will there be anything else?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
I beg your pardon?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Wockers with the knockers???
Must be the music room.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
If you like -- just hurry!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Well, this explains the music.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
I see what you mean.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Food!!

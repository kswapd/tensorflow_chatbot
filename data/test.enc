Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Hi.
Have fun tonight?
Well, no...
She okay?
Great
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
No, but
So -- which Dakota you from?
Who is she?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Number one.  She hates smokers
You told me that part already.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
What's the worst?
Where ya goin?
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
I say, do what you wanna do.
This is so patronizing.
Dorsey.
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Wholesome.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Put your right foot there --
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Bianca did what?
You think?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
You were right. She's still pissed.
You're completely demented.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Have a great time, honey!
Did I have anything to say about it?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
I could be gone for years.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Father...
No...
You defend yourself admirably...
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
How long?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
What do you read?
Where can I meet this man?
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
But it's...
Your mother was blind?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Are you alright?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
What's he looking for?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
How many victims are up there?
Is it drug related?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.
You promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Two weeks.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Whore?
Let me get a shot of it.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I'm serious.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I know.
I'm trying to tell you.
I'm here for movies.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
I'll take him.
Well, he killed my partner!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
It's about my salary cheques.
Really.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I thought so.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
That's true
I understand.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
What's the matter with my place?
Hello, again.
Here you go, baby.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You here to write my life story?
Yeah?
You're crazy.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Luther was part of the gang?
Hey, this works pretty good.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Well?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
You made that move, huh?
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Half a million.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah, I see her.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Which one pulled the trigger?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Hey, you're right.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
No wonder you're so popular.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Hey...
Keep stallin'.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
...We're saved!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Who are you?
They all like this in your family, father?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Of course.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
What are we going to do?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Leeloo... is... she's...
I don't have time... I need to know.
I don't need one.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
The Fifth Element...
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
30 seconds...
6... 5...
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You know how to fly this thing?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
I'm not going.
It's my wife.
Apipoulai!
Finished what?
Uh...
Here we go again...
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
I'm so very sad.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Why?... Why would you need me?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
...Not far, now.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Okay, I believe you.
I love you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
What?
What are these?
What are you talking about?
What the fuck... !
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
... sorry...
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Yeah, who's this?
What?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
You got absolute zero.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
You're asking me why?
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Remember me?
I'm not a cop.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
... Hello... ?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
A daughter.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Pittsburgh?
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
I'm not positive this means anything.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Why do you think he did it?
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
Okay, I'll take it all.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Then you saw him, too?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
I don't get it.
Been up with Alice.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Something wrong with the stairs?
What?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Feeling better now?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
I'm so sorry, honey...
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
I don't understand.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Is there any way out of it?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Excuse me, Skipper---
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Swell!
He did!
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
This spring.
Oh.
He's on to us!
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
They said.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
No, I mean whereabouts.
Where'd you get the blood?
On your sleeve.
Sure you did.
I'm fucking out of here.
Yeah.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
I just think you used to be bad.
It's fun.
Are we going in this?
Pop?
How about a Big Mac?
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Don't go playing policeman.
On what you pay me?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
It's just...
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
How's she doing?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You've been married twice --
Coffee's perked.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
Hold on!
Who are you?
Something about my father?
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Marg!
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Just do it.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Yeah.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Find them everywhere. 
Then who shot him?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Alice!
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
But they start executing hostages in
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
How?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
My husband is a very courageous man.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Four...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Did they say anything about my family?
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
who can I say is calling?
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Shit.
What?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
You mean...
What will happen to him, Ted?
Are you afraid?
Now!
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; life support systems check.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
He's carrying a bomb.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Surely you can't be serious.
George Zipp said that?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Ted, what are you doing here?
What's the matter?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
We'd better get back now.
Good-bye, darling.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Roger.
Excuse me, Sister?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
You don't have squat.
William Harcourt?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Get the picture?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Who is he?
Was.  Divorced.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
Where'd you get this?!!
Well, let's roll, George.
What was that about?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
You got your vest?
This floor's freezing.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Movement!
Can't lock up...
Okay, let's do it.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
HOW MUCH TIME?
You did okay, Bishop.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Is she...?
I get the picture.
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
If I go.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
You son of a bitch.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Now, wait a second --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
What is it?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
The corner!  Ready?
Well you're not reading it right!
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Now many?
They'll get us.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Ellen.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
It's inside the complex.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
They cut the power.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
What did you say?
Cross my heart.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
How do you know?
What does he look like?
Is she a good fuck?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
What is it?
Now?
Yes.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Yes, my love?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
You're not going to do this?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
No. Don't answer it!
Why not?
Go back to bed.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
These are originals?
Alone.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
I said play!
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
My pleasure.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Sire.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Majesty!
Yes, where?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
You don't have secrets from me.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Where?
Is he working?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down!
No.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry. No.
Love, Sire!
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Do you believe in it?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Yes.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
And that's all?
That's wonderful!
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Do you want to rest a bit?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
How well are you trained in music?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
What?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Ballet? What ballet?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
That lady is back, sir.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Surely you're not suggesting...
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Aw come on, Alex!
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Bathroom.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
But...
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
We had an argument. He's being silly.
All right, you two, move along.
Who is this girl?
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
There were witnesses?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
You've never had bad dreams before?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Well, I like it here.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Hello.
What about it?
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
What do you think was wrong?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
It sounds far away.
Jack?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
It's you, David.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're not real.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
You were saying?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Hot chocolate?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
No kidding?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Whose death?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Fifty thousand dollars!
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
That don't do us any good.
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Me?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
No.
What's this?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
The theatre?
I don't know.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Got my letter?
Mr. Dickson?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
You haven't got a uniform?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Why pick on him ?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
I'm afraid so.
Hello, Helen!
What did you do with it?
Yes.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
How are you fixed?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
You can ride like that?
I couldn't lose him.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
Bob. I didn't...
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Damn!
But if we take their money and supplies...
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Where you boys going?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
She had a moustache.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
Beautiful.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Dammit!
We'll make them pay for this.
Where'd you get all these riders?
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Another dozen out back.
What?
Of St. Louis?
Then why can't I go in there?
Where the hell were you?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
What do you say, sir?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
You know him?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
That he was.
Uncle Frank?
Did you kill Yankees?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Yep.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Zee.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
I like that.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
What about that Rock Island bastard?
Not at all.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Good.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Just perfect.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
You wouldn't have done that?
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What the hell is that sound?
On a lot of lithium?
You like it there, don't you?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
J&B. Straight.
Are we here?
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end, see? So?
What are you doing tonight?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
Why don t you just go for Price?
I want a firm commitment.
Why? What's wrong?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're inhuman.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Where are you going?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Listen, what about dinner?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
It looks so soft.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
I said we are totally booked.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Jean?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Well.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
She's my...cousin.
Who?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Nice. Very nice.
Bad habit.
You sure?
Yeah...Yale thing.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I've questioned him.
I lost my job...
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
I'm just screwed.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Look at this.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
...wanna savor this.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
That'll be a test, won't it?
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
You're living here?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
What?!
We could move 'em up here.
...Hello?
Cool!
It's okay. Really.
I'm okay. It's going well!
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Every entry was authorized.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
...Were you?
Did I say something?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Do we post it on the Net?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Time?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
I told Teddy about you.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Does he know you know?
Maybe it's the satellite.
...You got my E-mail?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Did you tell Alice?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
You seem surprised to see me.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
Come in.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
When do I begin?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
That does not compute.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Why did you leave so soon?
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Why?
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.

Everything seems to be in order.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
An evil petting zoo?
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
I just don't see it.
Did you ever want to?
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Secret ...
Fear ...
You
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Quite a collection.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
What are you trying to do to me?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
You.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Strange.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
What on earth?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Is that what you think?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Was I?
I thought you played by the rules.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What is it?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Weather's turning nasty.
Think she really killed those agents?
Insane ... ?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Are you alright, young man?

Aren't you forgetting about something?
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.

Seventy-five hundred.
Great car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Hello?
Fine. How's everything going?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
God, you're a slob.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
That feels so great.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I don't believe you.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Give him the works.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
So, Larry, how have you been?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Really?
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
It's on the tenth floor.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
I'd love that.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where the hell is he?
I'm not really hungry.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
How'd it go?
How 'bout this?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Been ripping off fire stations?
Why'd you come here, Brian?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Ya love it, probie?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
I'll handle it.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
You're back.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
You think that's really any of your business?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Are you still here?
Read.
Nice bunch of guys.
Your brother was a good man.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Who's going to die?
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Inspector.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
I'm a little busy right now --
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
People.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
...Benedict Arnold...
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Yeah, him.
We're ready when you are.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Good morning, Cheeba.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
My tap shoes.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm feelin' dis'!
That's a great handle.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Go away, unless you got my money.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Let's get him over to the bed.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Nobody told me anything.
You lost me.
I'm in till the end.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
Your life will never be the same.
We both lied to him.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
So they can be on TV.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
How's the food?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Yes he did.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Finland.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Around...
...then what about...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
I don't know who I am.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
Oh you do, huh?
Aw, c'mon.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
What is the service, sir?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I'll match any man with the sword.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
No.
How so?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Will we always leave it at this?
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
By name only.
Does this assignment interest you?
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
You too?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
We don't need the tapes --
What business?
Cadet, what's your name!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Whose blood is that, Jay?
You know it's not like that --
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
His chest was hamburger --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
How do you know?
MAYBE WHAT --
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
I'm sorry, Bill.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
He's in interrogation?
Move him.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
We're fucked, I know --
I pushed him too hard.
We were close to something with Kendall.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Hardy, what are you doing --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Your phone number?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
But you didn't see it, right?
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
What happens to Dunbar now?
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
I have to leave. Tonight.
Bloom!
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Well, she... uh...
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You're not trying to run away?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
I thought you weren't dying.
Why not religion, Dad?
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Dad!
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Where are we headed?
It's unbelievable.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
Oh.
Daffodils?
I was drying out.
I don't believe it!
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Do you like it, being pregnant?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Is he awake?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
Yeah it was okay.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You can see why it's sensitive?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
When?
Put the fucking kettle down.
He wants a lot of money.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't want to know.
I do. I want to very badly.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
Fine.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
I don't want to talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I don't hate you.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
It wasn't what I wanted.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Have you had any before?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I don't know.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
No. What? No. I know.
What does it mean?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
What are you doing?
Then start taking them seriously.
Lazarus?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
I bet you have loyal customers.
When? Now? Oh. No.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Or what? OR WHAT?
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Where's Ronnie?
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Want another?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
I know that.
You need some weed?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
He tapped that.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
So...  That your first time?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
This ain't gonna work.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I feel better. Do you?
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are they doing now?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Let's go.
This should be it...
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
You'll take care of that.
Nick!
What happened?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Where does this Sugai live?
I want to go talk to him.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's illegal, Nick.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Where's the wife?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
We're in?
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Dope?
One guy do all the damage?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
It's not your job.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
Why tell me this?
With these?
That wasn't our deal.
He knows what he's doing.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
What, Sebastian?
Show me something?
You could help us.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
You're our best and only friend.
I think, therefore I am.
You got a machine on it yet?
Industrial refuse.
She was gonna get away.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Yes?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
I think I have no money.
One more, eh?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
You're going to be over the limit.
My job is here.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
What shows?
It's a good job.
Me.
It's artificial?
Are you apprehensive?
Is there anything else?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I can imagine.
Who is this?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Did you cry when your father died?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
May I ask a personal question?
How many questions did it take?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Know what a turtle is?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You want to go home?
Where are your folks?
What about friends?
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Well, that depends...
Please excuse this interruption.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
So far?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
And that's it?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
Why are you doing that?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Thank-Q!
Very funny, smart ass.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
I guess we'll need another locker.
I don't want to be alone.
Bites what?
When do you need her by?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
I was wrong!!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Where's he gone?
I certainly do!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
No!  Not crazy!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
What about her?
That's ridiculous.
You wanted to see me!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
There.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Uh-huh. Adam?
My pleasure.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Are you all right?
Like one of Mom's?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
...the pipe tobacco.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Uh-huh.
You have very nice ceilings.
Not particularly.
I don't think so.
No.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
Bye, Troy!
Twenty-five? Around there.
The sky?  Where?
Say what?!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I'm afraid you've got to.
Right.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Really?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
It shuts off automatically.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
What's that noise?
Is there a problem?
Watch this!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
How long will you set it for this time?
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Alright, I will.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Gay.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank. Come in.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
What is this? What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Who knows you have these?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Yes.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
No. I should go.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'll call you.
Oh no.
They hurt his head.
He's comin' back? What for?
MOMMY!
Who's this fuck?
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
No thanks.
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
Can I use the car tonight?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
So, what's next?
OK.
You want a Dairy Queen?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
It's good to see you.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Just for him?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
There's ways around that.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Yes sir.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Anybody see ya?
Yeah, well...
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
They got nothing.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
What?! What are you doin'?
No ma! No!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Hey Murphy?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nervous?
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
So what do you think?
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
We do not want your tired and sick.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
And number three, Dolly.
So, what do we do now?
What?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
The what man?
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Fuck you!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Don't do this my son.
Have you no fear of God?
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
What color hair does he have?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
I'm lookout.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
What about what that guy said?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Can I get that credit card from you?
Well, then cut it in half.
Yes, they are.
OK. Go ahead.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Inez, this is --
See, now we've got a plan.
He told you and you let him do it.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Why don't you come with us.
She doesn't need to know.
Our money situation is not good.
Sixteen dollars.
When'd you get back?
I want you to look at this.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
He doesn't want to fight.
You're all clear.
Freeze!
What are you doing?
Come on.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
You're living on a sailboat?
Does it float?
So how is it in there? 
No. I'm not.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
You mean like techniques?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Exactly. Woah.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
See you.
Where you going?
Anthony, I --
Bob, where you going?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Was Future Man adopted?
You OK, Bob?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Where'd they come from?
Wait. Did he see us?
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
I paid for it.
What happened?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
I know it's not.
Just get in the car, Bob.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Wait a second --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
I might have mentioned it.
How you doing, Bob?
He said you ran away from home.
Oh, yeah.
Is that your chiquita?
You told me Bourne was dead.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
And Bourne? Where's he now?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
She say what time I should call?
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
That's not what happened to your parents.
I emptied it.
Pamela Landy?
What's going on in Berlin?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
No... How?
But we were so careful.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- it's just him? --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I love you, too.
I did.
I know it's a dream.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
And you got to him before we could.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
My first job.
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
We need to get in there.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
How long have you worked for the agency?
What kind of problems?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
Peace?!
Young Robert, we are honored --
Does anyone know his politics?
He won't come.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Rest, William.
You know it's a trap.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
We must run in different directions!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I do not confess.
Thank you for accepting.
I want... to marry you!
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
You have... you have a husband.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
No dances, just tell me.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
What happened?
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
There must be a way to fix this.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Dad lives here?
Are you hurting her?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
So how's Tommy?
Not if you remember my dad.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
What's happened to you?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Where are we going?
I don't get it.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Smells like sex in here.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Meant no offense.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Lenny? Come on!
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Yes, I'll bet.
And you want to know --
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Good.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Yes, I come.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
What do you want for Sam?
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
And Mademoiselle?
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Yes?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Put them on the table.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
You are very kind.
Goodnight.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Ilsa, I --
Yes, Victor, I was.
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Yes.
-- Is what?
Your work.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
No. It's all arranged.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Yes.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No, Captain, please.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
And that is?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
What else, my dear Major?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Hello, Louis.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
This is the end of the chase.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, no, Rick never --
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Give me another.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Hello?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Boss!
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
No.
What are you doing?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
What's so damn funny?
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
No.  that was the last one.
You?  Personally?
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
I have to.
This isn't working out.
"We're" not over-reacting.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
What's that, written on the sail?
What was inside?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
When's the next Jumbo?
I am one lucky guy.
Yes, yes he did.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I was making a point.
That's why you're a gambling man.
For the third time.
I beat the odds!
Cool ropes.
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
Take your time.
What, then?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You don't miss it?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
"...did." Well, okay.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Liberator...
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
It's almost like flying.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
What business is you in, Homer?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
First pregnancy?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Where's the name sheet?
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
I am not a doctor.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Do you like to read?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Do you know him?
Then it's malaria?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
I told him that you all is sick.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Ten percent. Of how much?
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
I can see why you liked her.
Nice.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Like what?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Who's that?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Jake...
Moonan. Here. Shit...
What? I can feel you looking at me.
How much we going after?
She up for this?
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Jake --
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Why?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Sorry, I --
Attractive girl.
What -- What do we do?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
That's not --
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Mr. King, I think --
I don't trust anyone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
You told me to change my hair!
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You tell them the "Tale".
Tick-tock...
Yeah.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Him.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Stand up.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
The King, huh? Nice going.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
It's just insurance.
I'm Bella.
You're shaking.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Three years, two months. March '93.
I don't gamble.
Last hand.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
It came my way. 450 a week.
What's the time?
You're shaking. What is it?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
The door, Jack.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Oh hello.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Which side do you like?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Hello...
You've been avoiding me.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Does Bella come here?
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
What happened to Bella?
Where did you go to school?
How many aces are left?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
You can start Monday week.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
It didn't go off.
What the hell?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
It is intuitively obvious.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Wha?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
TALBY!
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
You know what I think about, Talby?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
What happened, Doolittle?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
We're running out of time, sir.
Sir?
Oh, yeah?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
No wire.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
How're ya doin', Max.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Who is...
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Bent.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
I already don't like the sound of this.
Well, not me personally.
What's this?
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
This is not a place you wanna go.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
Morning, Sunshine...
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
That's odd...
No.
Yeah.
A fog bank.
Gotta go.
Only one I can think of.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
What about this?
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
You love him?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
We've got to take this slow...
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
No... You don't think...?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
I got...
Wait! I know how we can get in!
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Oh, hi, mom.
But, mom!
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Mom, what're we...?
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Is that your final answer?
I did?
Are you AFRAID?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Dea ex machina...
Why did you make me flood the school?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
How old is Grandma Death?
So... you just moved here?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Donnie?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
What?
Grandma Death.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Where are you going?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
What is her name?
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
How does that make you feel?
Nothing.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
What is going to happen?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Gerald.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
How did this happen?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Loretta, don't do that.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Oh shit!
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
C'mere. I love you so much.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
What're you doin' here?
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
That bitch from...
The bitch.
Lester?
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Here I am, Father...
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Who to?
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Have you got a license?
What kind of a dog is he?
Well - what is he now?
What do you whistle?
That was for you.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Send in the next girl. 
You no gotta no gun.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Are you getting tired?
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's even a greater honor.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
You stay with me.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Don't!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
This man belongs in hospital.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Good! How is the patient?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
Are you comfortable here?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...!
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Of course! You want out?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Yes!
Hello...
Good evening. How are you feeling?
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Who are they of?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Open up! I know you're in there!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Please! Please! What are those?
WHY?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
You're as bad as my father.
Erik. You don't understand.
Do you believe I love you?
Is it night or day, Erik?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
A lot of people like our singing.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
No. 
No.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
But it IS! Look!
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Louder.
Is THAT Odin?
What are you talking about?
How deep IS the ocean?
What?
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
You need to say a bit more than that!
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
Hy-Brasil?
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
It can't do you any HARM...
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Who's that?
What?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
I should have got rid of you long ago!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
No, it was lovely.
May I help you?
Ms. Kruczynski?
Come up to Boston with me?
What's wrong with me?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Why what?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I like it.
I don't really know how --
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Um --
You just say. I'm not really --
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Tomorrow?
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
So, um --
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Such a beautiful view.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What if you hide me?
You remember what happened next?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Happy Birthday.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I told her today I need to end it.
Hi there.
You know what I did.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Cool.
When?
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I should maybe talk to you.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
So you don't mind?
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Definitely!
It's freezing out.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's stopped.
He's coming?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Stan? What's going on?
Well, where was Patrick?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Oh, hi.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
What do you believe in then?
A traveler, eh?
Where are the others?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Why? Why do you have to go?
For magazines?
So now you're bummin' around?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Holy shit...
The containment, Second Containment...
You weren't there. I saw it.
Is that an offer?
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
What is it?
What's wrong?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Does he know that?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Justin, finish your sweep.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
We've got pressure.
I can see the hatch.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
That's a negative, Starck.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
It's 2041...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What are you?
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
You can't have them. Go to hell.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
It is now.  We're locked in.
But...
Skipper...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
It tastes bad.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Maybe one of the original crew?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
He served on the Goliath.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Almost got it.
What the hell is that?
You can't do that.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
What is it?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
What are you doing?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Where is Reed?
About me? How sweet.
What about his first born?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Isn't that your speech?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
We had a tough year.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben --
Reed?... Sue?
No more cracks about how I look.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
What are you doing --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
For science.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I can... make it work.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What's going on?
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Something happened to them, mon.
I can't find it, mon!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Any problems?
Leave me alone.
Jeff you have company!
Do you want to take a quick swim?
You're a really good kisser.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Hey, Rat.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Not if you're over sixteen.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
Who's that?
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
My brother's car!
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
So what did you do?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Well I never did it.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Dartmouth?!
Well, you'll find out next year.
What can I get for you tonight.
You keep them.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
...I've got to go home.
Where's Mike today?
Hi, Mark.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
...and we're chock full of that!
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
Shoot it.
That's good...
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
NO! Stop talking like that.
This is a fucking nightmare.
What is this?
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
So do we, lady.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
What?
Stop!
I will not die because of him!
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What tunnel? Where?
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Why do you take shit from him?
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
We gotta be close.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Really?
Will I go crazy or something?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
You wanna see, baby?
How much you got to see the show?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What's it for!?
How many?
Max?
I'll go with ya.
Welcome back.
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Yeah, maybe.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
HELP MEEE!
What's wrong?
DON'T!
Let's go!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
You know you don't have to do this.
Her name is Charlie.
What did we say about lying?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Excuse me, sir?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
You don't think I'm good enough?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Thank you, Ralph.
Bye, baby.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Francie, you know I can't do that.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
See you next weekend?
Age?
Why... yes.
What?
Okay then...
Whattaya mean?
How'd I look?
Frances...
I know what ability you're interested in.
Serious, huh?
Don't start, Farmer.
What for?
I'll bet.
Where are we, mean man?
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
That would be okay.
And no people.
Yeah.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
What happened? Who're you?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
You think I got it?
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
I think I need a little air.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Don't... talk crazy.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
...Did you really say that?
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Nice.
It can't be as bad as that.
You're an outcast.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
Friend?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
And if I consent?
What is this?
You will honor your promise to me!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Nothing. Still nothing.
I should go. I should leave today.
What does it say?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I've loved you all my life
I thought I'd never see you again!
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
It's going to ram us.
A warming wind.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
No. But someday.
Professor?
I am not mad.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Quite a few.
Now you've got him started.
They just caught the man who did it.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
The killer is still out there.
What'd you see?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Oh, my God...
What's the matter with it?
How come?
You saved my life.
Thanks.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Best over...
Anything else you want?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
Twenty-eight.
Yeah, follow us.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Is this real?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't like it, did ya?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Why not, against your religion?
What did you call me?
To your family.
Did he...?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
Creepy guy.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Do they have cable?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Do they have a waterbed?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
What'd ya see?
What does that mean?
You okay?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
What do you mean?
I'm here with you.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Of course, but there's more --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Then good night.
Permission to leave, sir?
Think I overplayed it?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
O'Neil?
She's haze grey and underway...
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
I'd sure like to know who.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
They're more afraid of you.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Say again?  How many micks?
Got it.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Subject?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Where's Audrey?
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
You never said it was off the record.
Circuits are overloaded.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Are you okay?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
My life sucks.
Your old sweetheart?
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman...
I can't.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Somebody must have seen it.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
It's the French Secret Service.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
Hello?
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
This is it?
Come on, old friend...
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Settle down, Alex...
What the hell is going on?!!?
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
May I get the check?
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
You said "the Commander.
He always has to make the big entrance.
Hi Brandon.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
How did you come to that conclusion?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
No, wait, are you-
What?  Up?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Covalent... Right. So...
How do you remember this stuff?
...The digital conveyor.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're alive!
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
It's Jason...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Are they behind us?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Clenched jaw...
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
You should have let me hit him.
I heard it too.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Theramin.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Former Commander?
Commander...
"Deception..." "Lies."
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Where?
NO NO NO.
Continue forward, sir?
Find them.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
What's your advice, Alexander?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
General Lee is detained captain...
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Any word from Canada?
A grand scheme?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
No, please; an advance on your salary.
You must be very rich.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Well, this must be about something!
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
All people have rights!
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
My daughter, I ask only...
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
You see the paper?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
And that's for the airport.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I need the money.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
She's great. Gimme the money.
I don't know.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Sovereign.
Get in line, bro.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Something shouldn't be there.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
You make movies, huh?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's it? That's your movie?
Part of it, yeah.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
One of his best parts.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
You've been losing.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
It's not one of these?
We call you a taxi.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I got you a copy of the script.
I think it's not horrible.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I miss Murray, Harry.
What's wrong?
How did you get in the house?
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
What's so great about Sweden?
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
One more?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Maybe that is his boat.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Did you?
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
I think you know.
The radio!
What the hell happened!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
Stay away. Or else.
She was sailing up north, right?
Why not call for help?
What guy?
Are you sure?
You just shoot at something?
How's he doing?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
What do you think happened on this boat?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Murphy to Epps.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Call the Coastguard?
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
How're you feeling?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
It's a Noaa buoy.
Can't find the shotgun.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And what can you tell us about this... 
...wow...
I...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
It's not optional!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
That guy rules!
Aren't there a million places like this?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Jesus, look at this guy.
What do you mean "why"?
Yeah, right...
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
How long have you been up?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
I might actually get the pasta special.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
Does Oomie really like this show?
What are you talking about -- who?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
Do you think he knows?
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
Where are we going?
There he is...
JOSH!
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Anthony's II!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
How repulsive!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
There.
Wow... finally.
We're not.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Punk rock is over!
Do you have any old Indian records?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I'm totally serious!
Every guy has a type!
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Jesus...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Wow, this is so cool...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
What, like a girdle?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Well when can we do something?
No, of course not.
What are you doing here?
Uh... sure... come in.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
Where did you get this?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
No... forget it...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
What do we have here, Margaret?
I don't know.
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Thank you, doctor.
No hints, Samuel.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
You've never built in Africa.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
...one shot...
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
I am also liaison between these two.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
What do you want with my baby?
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Good luck.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Well, good night, Louis.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I'd like to have a stool specimen
Pretty impressive, huh?
Who was that?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Is the line sinking?
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Are you all right?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Tell him about the toaster.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
You're the best one in your row.
Can't you tell me now?
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
But why?  The students love us!
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Great!  How's it going?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Oh!  You're here.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Something was definitely here.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
What now?
Sorry, Buddy!
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
What is it?
I told you it's real.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
How was your date?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Who was the architect?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Don't you think you should at least wave?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Those are priceless sculptures.
What is that... wailing?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I am their hero!
Then you'd be out of a job.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Caesar, ignore them.
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
You cannot die.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Take your hands off me animal!
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Then get a large cash advance.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
Will you take me home now?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Where we going?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
All right.
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
You mean the one who --
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Let me go.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
The day after tomorrow?
657-2036
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
You a student?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Mr. McCleery?
What for?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Can I help you, sir!
Is anything wrong, sir?
Where is it?
Sir?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Then why do you keep running away?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Hello, Benjamin.
He didn't see me.
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
What?
Well.
Yes?
You what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
What?
Always?
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
But you don't hate him.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
What?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Good.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Mrs. Robinson --
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I say I've got it.
Nothing else.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
I guess -- about my future.
I don't know. I want it to be --
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
What?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
I am not threatening you.
But why?
Can you see me now?
Have you a minute now?
No -- no -- no -- no...
Like dancing?
That was lovely.
I'll do anything for you.
Why?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I want to be alone.
What can you see?
No.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
I'll go -- good-bye.
Very early in the morning.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Bless you...
I can't.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
The Baron is tired?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't know.
Any letters?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Please -- please!
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Am I!
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
You're a little too fast.
Cotton Company --
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
What?
No water -- What a place!
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Yes --
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Shall I tell them again?
You're a deep one.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Take them back, Suzette.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
How is the house?
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know -- I know.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What's the matter with you?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What you need is some relaxation.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Motherhood.
No.
You want a drink?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You're a thousand percent right!
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Not much time.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
I like those.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Going somewhere?
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Let me see how you did that one.
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Roy? It this all we have?
Her job.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
The tap. What you do for a living.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Atascadero.
Yeah?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
What's that?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Mr. Simms.
Carter.
Where?
That's it?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
My god...
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit?!
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
What?  Where is she?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You look kind of cold.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Ooooh, busted.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
You've been watching too much TV.
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Mommy, I'm scared.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
See what I'm talkin' about?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Where are you going?
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
A bitch.
No.
I suppose.
You know what gets me?
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
You know what gets me?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Me?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Blue soup.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Insurance!
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Gee whiz--
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
You were about to ask a question?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Can I get dressed first?
What kind of exercise?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
What do you do for a living?
Disease?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
Your old beau?
You used to like it stark!
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Breakfast?
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
What then?
It couldn't!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Go on.
No.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
None.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
This is man to man.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
The new hero is you.
You're too modest.
Here.  Finish the job.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Don't shoot.
New lives begin!
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
What happened?
How horrible.
So long, you guys.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Kid--kid--
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
No.
I know.
He's a ghost!
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I hate that thing.
Is Norbert still here?
What?
I hate that thing.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
He'd assume we had.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What's the matter now?
Possibly.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
You and Harold are friends?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You know each other?
You fool, you fool.
Do it!
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Yeah.
I just want to ask some questions.
What?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Nah.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
No.
Say what?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Is that the way it was with you?
How important do you think sex is?
What's T-J?
What the crap?
More or less.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Granville?
What happened?
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
I've got a meeting...
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
How's your business, Jake?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Com'on, tell me.
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
How long have you been driving?
Check.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
What do you want?
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
Do you dance?
Do you sing and dance?
Yearse!
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Sort of.
All right.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You don't look eighty.
That's a nice teapot.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Thank you.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
He's stopped.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
But they have.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Yes.
Why?
It looks like you. Thanks.
Supper for two.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
This is insane.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Fifteen.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
You liked your teachers?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Stay where you are, Harold .
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
He... he loved me.
It's coming.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
Well... G'bye.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Nonsense, I...
I... remember.
Steve...
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
That's all for you, Sammy.
hound of resurrection --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's almost over!!
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
How does he know so much about me?
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Who's the squirt?
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
-- should go back. Now!
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Myers??? How's your arm?
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
Where do you --
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Goodnight, then.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Out? Out out?
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Yes, I --
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Will you sign for the bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
That your daughter?
Lucky man.
We've got such sights to show you --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Julia!
Bastard.
You're Julia, right?
Julia.
Back from where?
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
Kirsty.
Sure.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You're still blaming me.
How are you doing through there?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Maybe a brandy.
-- I'll go see.
What's wrong?
You know, you're very beautiful.
You're awake. Good girl.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Who's there?
Well I want you to see the house.
Of course. Every day.
Big house.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
It's like she's waiting for something.
I have to talk to you.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
He's gone.
Where are you going?
I see.
Meaning what?
Oh!
What's wrong?
What did I say?
'Bye.
Alison's.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Play it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
We'll do it next Monday.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
What?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Don't do it, Rob!
What are you talking about?
May I help you?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Is that it?
Good weekend?
Rob --!
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Well we rang $900 today.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Can I help you?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What were the others?
What?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Yeah.  Great.
You won't like it.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Hi.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
Will you call me?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Me?
Do you want me to be there?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What do you want to do?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
You know, with Ray...
Look, we can do other things.
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
More confident, maybe.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Nothing.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
No.  Probably not.
About what?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
What's happenin'.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Enough, Liz.
So you live in Chicago now?
Don't you like that?
It's a great song.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
You haven't even seen it!
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Which way are you going?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
I think you have more.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
I have friends.
No.
You're wrong.
You did kill those men.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
Maybe it would do us both good.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I hope I never get that old.
Who are you?
I didn't kill the watchman.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
There are differences.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
What were you doing in Felton?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
You're not from these parts.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
How can you know this?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
How can I stop such a man?
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Oh please.  Another one.
Something pretty.
Who am I deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
No doubt.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
We must talk.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
The last four.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Run!
Do you know what this is?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
All I need is time.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
The resemblance is amazing.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Are you back?
What doing?
I'll keep you in mind.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
Too hot?
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Oh, she was here.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Just for the first year.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, she'll know some day.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Call Duffy!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
He's in the insurance business.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
What tricks would I pull?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Railroad tickets.
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Look at me, Hildy --
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Flip a coin.
Where'd you wire him?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
How about Bruce's?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Let's see the money.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Boy, did you see her go?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
What a chase!
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
He's harmless.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Who is this man?
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
And so do I!
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Who is it?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Where's the money?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Hey --
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
For heaven's sake, why not?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Pinkus.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
This is going too far, young man.
It's true.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I know a secret.
You want to join our gang?
Sod.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
You couldn't.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Who with?
I did see them. I did.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Crocodiles! Aah!
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
Why not?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
What would we do if a German came into the house?
What is it, pet?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Is it peace in out time?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
I wish it could all have been different.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
Molly!
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Is your brother ready to go?
I'd like to see that.
What the hell are you laughing about?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
No, really.
The Duke?
But if you did.
She's pretty cute.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Perfect.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
She looks like she stinks.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Almost there.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Hey, he moved.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Drive through it!
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Thank you.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
Oh, right.
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Where's Bill?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Turn up this road.
And?
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I am sleepy.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Fine.
What?
Please. I look a mess.
Hunh.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
Nice night.
Progress!
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Oh?
How'd you know where I was?
Done!
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
What are you doing in there?
Did you see that?
Who from work?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Bravo to you, Puff!
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Extra dessert?
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
That's your problem.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Thinking about what?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
When do I raise the bet?
I got time, Bert.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
You don't need a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Oh yeah? Where?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Just like that?
Findley.
That's right. When?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
You quittin' too?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
You quittin', friend?
Yours.
Have a nice trip.
Can I sit down?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
What do you do on the other days?
Hey!
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
What time is it?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
Where you been all day?
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eddie, what's in that case?
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
He's a gambler.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
You glad?
Well, what's so funny?
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Where's Bert?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
What about... now?
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
Shhh... don't talk.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
You built things.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
It was so real, Dad.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Why?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Don't go in.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
What's his family background?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
What do you want me to do?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Love was never our problem.
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
There's good news and bad news.
What're you talking about?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Pops!
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
What the hell is that?
Spunky?
You try Martin?
This I can see.
We're loose!
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Grey, you read me?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
That's impossible...
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
Your son.
Really? Ballet?
Oh. Sorry.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
I don't need it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
The Word of God...
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Schneider?
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Don't wander off.
My room!
What are you going to do?
But what are you doing here?
Dad, they come in through the doors.
If only I could have been with you.
They want my diary.
You did!!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
No! Don't Shoot!
What?
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
The penitent man is humble before God.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Why are you trying to kill us?
This is your last chance.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Interested in local curios?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
What?
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
I ride with you, Indy?
What you look at, Indy?
What does it mean, Indy?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
What do you mean -- how?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Don't let it pull you deeper!
What's happening?
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
He's afraid of something.
Any more complaints?
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
WILLIE?!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
So now they believe me.
Try me.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Somebody's been here.
Yeah...Who?
You've heard of the PEM114...
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I know...it sounds insane.
You'll be alive.
You weren't listening!
I'll talk to them.
What's that?
What'd he look like?
I wouldn't say that.
I want out.
Yeah...Who is?
What do you mean we.
Sue them.
Door's locked.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'm back.
Who is it?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
You mean...just leave.
I'll get in trouble.
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
The beach?
Holy shit!
Do you notice anything.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
She's...pretty fast.
Help me out, will you?
What?
Touch her.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
What is it?
You really like that shirt?
Mind your own business.
Get close to them.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
It's embarrassing.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
Come on, she's getting away.
Where are you going?
He was with Gruner!
I don't trust her.
Left...The one with the red dot.
He hung us up dry.
Do it.
Be quiet.
You're a lucky man.
What are you doing?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Can you fly this?
What kind of a deal?
Impossible.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You've cut your hair?
That crazy guy?
I don't want to intrude.
...Foreign service.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
We're here.
Who?
Al?
Ahhh...nothing.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
The fresh tuna?..
What do you want?
Blake said that?
And you.
Let you leave without it.
Wait. What's your name?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
As if your mind's not all there.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Joe! What happened to you?
He didn't.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Who was?
Why not?
Are you alright?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Is there anything else?
Could I have it, please.
Right there.
Mom.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
P.J.'s.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Are you all right?
What are you cooking?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
You're exaggerating!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
What caliber is my gun?
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Lowell?
Use the bathroom.
Thank you, Bob.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What?!
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Yeah.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
Lowell.
Lowell!
Did I get you up?
Give me a break!
I know what I have to know.
...but that's as far as I go...
Should I just take the documents now?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Lowell, I can't afford --
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
No? No, what?
I told the truth!
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Where are you, anyway?
Did he hear you?
What about now?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object to the form!
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Baby. You are so HOT!
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
What the hell is Botox?
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
He'll regret this.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Hello?
Marylin? When did I say...?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
And here I thought my mother was...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
You don't like me?
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Hello?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
We are. And it's winding down.
I was devastated. Of course.
Wow.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Lilly's up.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
You're not...
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
So what?
Well, that's about to change big time.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
That's delusional.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
And she has...?
What do you think?
Berry spoons.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She owes me a meal.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
What ten thousand?
What's this about not eating?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Oh, no—no.
Are you going to see him?
Why should she? After all—
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Whadda you want!
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
My ticket?
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Here, boy!
Now, just a minute—you can't—
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Do you mind putting out the light?
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
King—King Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Detectives!
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Aren't you afraid of me?
Not a one.
What!
What's got into you?
Thought you were hungry!
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Carrots.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You think it's simple, huh?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
What about money?
That's swell!
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Yes—if he is your husband.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
I said, the old man's screwy!
The dame's too smart for him.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
What's the thousand bucks for?
If it's on the level.
You!
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Mush. Mush.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Mebbe.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
See that. They're gone!
Then—you'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Well, you're two up on me now. 
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
And Oswald?
Recall any names?
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
Why?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
You still questioning any Cubans?
It leads farther than that.
...give me protection?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
Are we going away, Daddy?
I'm scared.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Who?
Let me show you his picture. 
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
It never did. 
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
How many men are working with you on this?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Can I help you?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
What's the problem?
Look, man, I know I owe you --
She sound scared?
What's she want?
This is your money?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
You don't want much, do you?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
That doesn't sound dark.
What have they told you?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
You get a chance to use it?
This is pretty.
'76?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Fifteen thousand.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Did you do it that night?
It'll be more than that.
Where's the rest of it?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Ray wants him.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
What if I plead guilty?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
We'll just be a minute.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Not really.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
How long you been with Ordell?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Beaumont Livingston.
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Yeah?
I got a problem...
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's the idea.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Plus the same deal as before.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Drink?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Want a hit?
Where at?
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
You're fourteen years old here?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
Did you ever go I one?
I lived there for about nine months.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Please.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
Thanks, Baby.
As low as two.
Guess where I am?
Who was that?
What did he do?
It's Louis.
You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
They don't have your winning personality.
How can I help you?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
I'm alone.
How the fuck did he find me?
Well, give it to me then.
This place stinks.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Uh-huh.
It's the next street.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
You sure?
We're back.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
I'm alive.
Remember?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
You're hurting me!
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Hey, wait!
Doctor.  Ph.D.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
He say what they looked like?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Not me, buddy.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
I had this weird flash just then.
What are you doing?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
No.  I see them.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
What was that?
She was good in bed, though.
What do you think?
The room!
You up?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
Yeah, but for what?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
Jake!
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Why? What for?
What the hell are you doin'?
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I know.
Don't!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
How?
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
What's going on?
WHO ARE YOU?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Oh God!
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I can't move.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Where's Wong?
He's burning up.
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
Can I help you?
Is he all right?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
I don't have all day, kid.
Goodbye old friend.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Okay that hurt.
You see that?
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
How many?
It bought us some time.
You're a teacher.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Sergeant!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Pull me in!
Outta here?
Rizzo?!
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Did you like it?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Now what?
That's really funny.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I'll help you in.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Barbie from hell...
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Almost done.
Sorry, sorry.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
I missed you too.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Kicker!
What?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Azrael can you repeat that?
What good will that do?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Can we get through these?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
This is Matt Hooper...
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Did you get him in the head?
He's trying to sink us!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Right.
Can you stand something to eat?
You too, sweetheart...
Got a pen on you?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
How can you tell?
He ate a car?
...Nothing.
What is all this stuff?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
What happened?
What's that, a ship?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Christine what?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Well... is everything all right?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
What's that supposed to prove?
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Coming right to us!
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Is that normal?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
You're being really immature.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
What, you mean as friends?
I try really hard, actually...
Hey man.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Just like our moms and teachers!
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
No.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
I know what junk is.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Uh, thanks.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
You do?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Excuse me?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Or...
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
You're not listening to me.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
So. What's that thing?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
We're actually, finally doing this?
Hi, I'm Adele.
...Pardon?
Are you takin' the pictures?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
I'm cool.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Carryin' a gun.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What if they're dangerous?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
...thank you.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
So what do you do Early?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This guy killed a mess of people.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
So tell me... what happened here?
You two been busy in here.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...and I think I know why.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
What's that?
What about you?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
...You know what I mean?
What happened?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Oh man, that's the best.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
78th.
Did she suck your dick?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't understand why you do that.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Casper.
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper! Was up kid?
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
You sure?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What do I want to do?
Because your a virgin?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Telly says was up.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
I hate sucking dick!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I'm coming.
Do you know where he went?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Oh shit.
Yep.
I hate 'em.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
You want a wip-it?
Right.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
I can't man.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Morpheus.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
What are you talking about?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Why does he call Sanderson?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
What?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Please... wait.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I know where you are.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Nope.  Nothing.
Now what?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Is your dad here?
I know he really likes you.
Who told you that?
What is it, dad?
It isn't Kathy.
What about prints?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
That's it?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Feel like practicing?
Bainbridge Books.
Are you one of the players?
Sounds very violent.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Do you always open quickly?
Well, I think I've had enough.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead after the game.
I think it's interesting.
In a way.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
I'm just curious.
Of course.
No.
Doesn't that scare you?
Alright.  What about me?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
What?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I just don't want to fight with you.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
Fine.
Peter...
Peter...
Because I know what it says.
I lied.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I will find you. I will be with you.
Take the western passage.
That's a better one.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
They have Lyssa!
The White Castle has fallen.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
You have not slept in two days.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
I cannot reach her.
But you suspect.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Once is enough, thank you.
Fame.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
I'm not hungry.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
My heart stays here.
Sugarballs?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
It's a lie!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
A fine match.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Each to his fate, lad.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
Do not try your trickery on me!
...You moved too, didn't you?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
OK, I'm fine.
Rocket launcher.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
May I go to the cinema?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Poor darling, and then?
...No...
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
I don't know... Five minutes.
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Don't fear.
...Who sent you?
Salute.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I have to finish first.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
The new store?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
I want children.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
What did they ask?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
From where?
Why?
Doubts?  About what?
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
When are you leaving?
You're walking to California?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
What do your friends call you?
Good morning.
I don't have kids.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
How are you feeling?
What's your shoe size?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Orange soda?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
Don't run away.
You OK?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
How long have I been here?
Me neither.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
There are limits.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Where are you staying?
You have been lonely?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Come again?
I'm sorry, but --
What's going on?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
The idiot speaks.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
So?
Okay, how would it work?
Hey --
Oh, my God!
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Almost.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
I did?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I completely agree.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
That's not entirely --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
She's naked.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
You go?  Not watch fun?
We come watch... we come watch...
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
You're a beast!
Might we watch, too?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You come stealee tleasoo?
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
Enough!
No... I... I need to rest.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Are we here?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Shhhh!
Damn them!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Good.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
Certainly understandable.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Wait, Jack.
Can we trust him?
Aye.  We're good as inside.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Sunlight.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I was with the Princess.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
You see!  You see!
We seek to undo the curse.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
These for me?
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A gentleman would offer water.
What shall we do?
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Jack!
Who?
They tricked you.
Tis the truth.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Tis not fit for a princess.
I have no wife.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Sunlight?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Biting you?
I can't see a thing.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
This is not the time for squabbling.
I'd be honored.
Wondrously so.
Where?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Lost?
Can you show us the way?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
In a dream.
Dad's disappeared!
And video games after!
What's that for?
Oh.
Red.
What are you doing up so early?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Don't you have school?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
It's not what I was expecting.
Where's your dad?
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Not really.
Why is that?
He won't leave my room.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Is Alyssa here?
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
You'll have to explain that to the police.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I'm not going!
It bugs me.
I don't know.
I'm not doing it!
I can promise you complete privacy.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Where is it?
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
I know parts of who you are.
I loved him too much.
I still don't know what that means.
I still don't know what that means.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
Because Dad left?
You should lock your doors.
Lock the door behind you.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Four days.  I left to think.
I love those doors.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I drove over and you were gone.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
What is it?
With your hands or your tongue?
Where's Sam?
You brought your kids?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
Peter left me yesterday.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
Nothing.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
He said he heard hammering.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We've eaten.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'm helping George build his house.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
I've missed you guys.
What are you doing in my room?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
All day again?
Adam, that's not true!
She's doing just fine.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You know I trust you, Claude.
I got it... boss.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
What are they gonna do to us?
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
You're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Don't mention it.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
I know people.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Crop duster.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Back to New York for starters.
I can't do it.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
How you doin'?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
What are you doing here, mama?
I can't take that, mama.
They gave me life, mama.
Is everyone here?
What's going on here?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
That's what I thought!
Hello, Cassius.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What's Nicky doing down there?
Where is he? He's late.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
I mean... tough break.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Hey.
Thanks.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
What's with that guy?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Which way did he go?
Come on. One more time.
You gotta kill yourself.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You got the wrong window again, man.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
It's freezing my hands.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
..."The Devil?"...
Yes. What is rent?
Hey...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Answer the question!
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Do you have anything special in mind?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Who invited you?
That was a great shot you made.
Of course.
About what?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
What Quad do you live in?
Maybe... sure...
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
And then you killed him, right?
I don't..
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
What do you suppose this was...?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
We can't. We're going back.
Things change!
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're not contagious are you?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Listen.
You want somethin'?
You okay, man?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
Do you own a video camera?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
What a fuckin' job.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Hello.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
You all right?
Alice...
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
You don't look so good.
The police called us.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
That's not Fred Madison?
Yeah, Mack?
When he went to work, right.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
What is this, Rogoff?
Where's Alice?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
Who's it from?
It must be from a real estate agent.
From the club. You didn't answer.
I had a dream about you last night...
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
The heart, I guess.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Okay.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
What's goin' on?
Why haven't you called me?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What do you want?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes, sir.
Not even a radio?
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I see.
Look here—
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
And the wine - excellent.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
When was all this?
Well, is it?
Very often.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
What do you want?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Are you taking me?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
He's dead.
Well - I mean—
Uh-huh.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
I'd go mad!
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm so glad.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
I wasn't scared...
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
We'll take it from here.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
The radio show?
Jesus...
How does that help me?
Since how long?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
Sure.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Kay?  What's your 20?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Agatha --
Agatha...
Please, I want to go back...
I have to go back.
She grew up.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
John?  What is it?
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
That's not much.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
You the sentry?
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
You the only sentry?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
Lara called me.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
You can't run --
Seventeen minutes.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We can't grab it...
What?
Red Ball?
Confirm with trig and image.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
To them.
Really?  You've never been inside?
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
Flaws.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She was looking right at me.
She spoke to me.
Wally, listen to me...
Are these all of her previsions?
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
What the hell.
You're alive?
Oh, Sean --
Who are you?
Sean, wait...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Who made you do this?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Heal who?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
Why should I trust you?
Which one is that?
This is all my fault.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
I understand.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Can't they shut that off?
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Howard --
You know I need to use you.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure?
Thank you, sir.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
So, wait, you're from where?
Is he cute?
Should I fuck him?
He's great, right. Is he great?
No.
What's wrong, baby?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
You talk to Max today?
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
He making the drop?
So, when's the drop.
What's that?
So what do we do?
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
Where we going?
A million. Easy.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
I didn't say that.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
What's the plan?
Where is the Soho Grand?
No. Just the cross streets.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Sorry, man, but...
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
How am I being shitty?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Fuck them.
He implied it.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I like it.
C'mon, man...
How much is it?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Great. On my fucking room.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Oh really. Why's that?
What are you doing?
They didn't say an address?
How'd they know who you were?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
What the fuck is that supposed --
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You happy?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You fucking nuts?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
He wants to see us now.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Nothing, man.
No.
I'm sorry...
So what do we do?
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
C'mon...
I want to leave right now.
What's up, man.
How much is what?
Yes.
How do you know it's not drugs?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
I'm half Irish.
What do you want?
Coke?
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Yeah.
A lot of Persians?
Keys.
We're square.
No. I'll take a strega.
No...
So, we're talking money laundering...
Yeah.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Why?
How's it feel?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
You're a damn liar.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Don't con me.
What the hell for, man?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
I can't.
Is the program ready?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Let's talk about you for a change.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Did you hear what I said?
It won't be easy.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Can I ask you something?
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Let's go.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You evil this morning.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
That ain't bad.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
You want to be the head man?
Who the hell are they?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
A lot of people are looking for you.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
Where do I find you?
[Reina Rosas.]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Please, don't...]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
What is it?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
No.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Hmmm?
And don't start crying.
You're fast.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
You feel sorry for the husband?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
You don't drink like you used to.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Jordan!
Creasy... Wait.
Rosanna Guerrero.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
[You have the money.]
Yes, mom?
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
She likes him.
Creasy.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[Who's that?]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
You helped him get this job.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
I could see she likes you.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Who told you that?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What they say?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Yeah.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
This is the kitchen.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
No...
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Are you kidding?
I'm just here with another girl.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Don't worry about it.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Hello, Ralph.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Well...
Tommy!
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
What are you going to do with him?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Where?
Miss you, Walt.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Y'all mind the store.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
You – must – open – me – up – again?
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Y'all just act natural.
Never mind. Forget it.
Never heard of him.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Give us this day our daily...
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
Gimme three.
You betcher ass, Dad.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
What's the matter?
See you.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
O'Reilly!
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Never mind.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Action?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yes!
Oh. Yeah.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Can I help you pack?
Ted Sheldon.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
What?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
That's our man. He's made to order.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Okay, fellows.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
What's the idea?
Where's Connell?
Where'd you play?
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What do they want?
Yeah, Boss?
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
What's your name?
That's got nothing to do with it!
No, I didn't write it, but—
It's for Ann . . .
Flowers.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
What do you mean, too bad?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Is there a crowd in the street?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
I won't get away with it.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Tell my dad.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Really?
What?!
Manual or automatic?
Hold on a second here.
Anything on Korda so far?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
For now that's all.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
Recruited you from where?
How did you like Toronto?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
Tell me what you need.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
What did you see?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
We won!
How long you been coming here?
Is it always like this?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
How many have you lost?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I know how you feel, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
I worship you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
And a car.
The car is part of the deal.
There are two million people in there with you.
Why --
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
You were the one who was dying.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
And what about the reconfiguration?
You sure he's going to come?
How long?
What?
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
A hotel?
There was no need to kill her.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
You went to my high-school?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Why?
I wasn't with you.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Access granted.  Male or female?
Standard, modern, upscale --
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Release the power with the power.
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
PTERODACTYL!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
All systems go!
NEW POWER COINS!!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
And how do we do that?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
I'm outta here.
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
I am the mighty ape!
NINJA APE ZORD!
So Chicago's been good to ya.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Life knocked me back.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Well...
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I been thinkin'...
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Come off it, Bugs.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Not stupid. Fat.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
He's an animal!
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Wanna know what I think?
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Maranzano wants you dead.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
DEATH!!
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
What's the matter?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Uh huh. And?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
Dating anyone?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Oh--that again. Yeah.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Did you like the first act?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
The war's on!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
One minute! Just one minute!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Jeff for Senator.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Where were you?
Thank you, sir.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Well--goodnight.
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Just fine.
What is it?
What's your name?
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
A *day*!
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
Have you always had to--work?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Abigail.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Already? All these letters?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Sure.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Oh--you are!
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Ax?
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Joe! You *told* him to!
I know that.
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You want to see me, Senator?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Why don't you do it yourself?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Anything *better* to offer?
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President...
Will the Senator yield?
Order!
That's going to be fun.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
He's still pixilated.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Now, what do you see?
There's Times Square.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
Yeah, I know.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
In a day or so, I think.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Hello, Mary?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Huh?
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Did it?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
When're you going to see him again?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Sit over there, will you?
How is this, sir?
He's what?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Will you have a cigar?
Why not? Who is he?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb—
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Have a drink?
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman?
Naturally.
Now, where were we?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Brookfield just came in.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
South Dakota - north?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
What do you think you're doing?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Yes, sir.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
You came home last night - without them.
But she's on the telephone—
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
I have eighteen more minutes!
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
Where's your wife, Henry?
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Althea hasn't told you?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
What it might take is... doing time.
Got a license?  But no car?
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
How are you?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Finally, some common sense...
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Even if you don't think it's real?
What would you do?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
You're doing great.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Which thing?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
Can I ask you a personal question?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
What?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
How's it coming?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Who else knows?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Did you carry a gun?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
You know where he's taking her?
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Goin' somewhere?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Where's your new friend?
Immune from what?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
And what did he say?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
That "thing" gets me excited.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
I'm not?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You called me your girl?
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
I'm your sister.
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Hey,... don't I know you?
None taken.
Where's my gun?
Who's here!?
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I knew you'd know.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
He was the last time I saw him.
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
He'll never make it.
That boy's got talent.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Who's the artist?
Come here.
Then why are you here?
Or talk?
Hi.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Bye. 
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
Have you ever seen him?
Cover me!
Nah.
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
The who?
Sounds good.
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
It is?
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Or Batman --
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
Ah -- you approve?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
And where is the army?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Who is there?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Why didn't you wake me then?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
That is correct.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
And he sent you to me?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Oh...?
No -- not as a rule.
Good evening, sir.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
What's your name?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
No... nothing at all.
When is she supposed to return?
Will you use the troops?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Were you in love with him?
And now?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Separate bedrooms?
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
That's all I can say.
You could hear them?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Come in.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Fuck, what's his name?
I ain't trying to rob you...
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
You straight?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
I walked.
You know what this is?
You better stop running from that girl.
What we gonna do?
You see that?
How you know?  It could be anything.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Huh?
You did all this for me?
Here I come!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Craig, remember what I told you.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Today ain't my day.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey.
Get 'em, Craig!
Ah damn.  Damn.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Huh?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
You were very nervous.
How do you know that?
Who did?
Come with us, sir.
What...?
How should I...?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Again.
Is that something precious?
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
We have to hurry.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Can we go now?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
You remember me?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Cover your mouth.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
What am I supposed to say to her?
Well?
Thanks for the shine.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
That's pretty good.
I'm not a baby.
You got this under control?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Foreigners! Fuck!
That's enough.
Any trouble?
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Yes! Yes!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Who?
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
What?
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
John...
Now can I tell?
Pearl! You ain't --
Where's Mom?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Where are we goin', John?
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Now it's your turn.
I'm hungry.
Can I have milk too?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Do you want more children, Willa?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
This man down at the Drugstore...
Miz Cooper!
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Bring him out of what?
What!?
She dreamed this would happen...
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
You okay?
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
You okay?
I never touched her.
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
Thank you, Comrade.
Good evening, Anna.
Aren't you late?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
An evening gown.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Capitalistic methods...
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
I am, Gaston.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We don't want to be disturbed.
If you want to see us you must come later.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Comrade Buljanoff...
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Give me another double brandy.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
On what?
What for... why?
How long do we have to wait here?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Is that customary?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Oh, let it ring.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Room service speaking.
I always eat here.
I wish they had never met.
You remember this room?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Thursday.
...and we won't clench our fist...
Would that make you any happier?
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
What did he say?
Make it ice cold.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
That bad?  Old or young?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Thank you.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Hello, Leon darling!
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
At Père Mathieu's.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
We could check the tape again, sir.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Executive clemency ...
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
How much do you need?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
McCord? ...
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
This is not a joke, John!
Why not?
No, you didn't, Bob.
This is June twentieth?
Sorry ...
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
No, sir, you did not.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
That was civil war.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
But what are we paying him for?
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Just do what I say, Bob.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Because they're not Americans.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
More light, chief?
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What'd you say?
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
No.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Ummm...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
You'll win the nomination.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Who do you think is behind it?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Jesus Christ!
You all right?
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Where you from?
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
What's in there?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Dick, don't...
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Tomorrow.
And what am I doing?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Why didn't you?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
It'll be over soon.
What?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How you been, Ellis?
Didn't know there was any.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Hard to believe.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
That's the boy.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
...This month's checks.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
You gave your word?
Goin' where?
You can't afford one?
Llewelyn?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Is somethin' wrong?
Yessir.
Now. We close now.
...What time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
You on all night?
Good. I need everything else.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Okay.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
It's called a transponder.
Not that way.
Why would he go to Odessa?
The heroin. You don't have it.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Are you jackin' with me?
Don't jack with me.
Could I have that in American?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You should get the order you want.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Bad idea...
Junior year!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
You're lying!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Great. Good. Content...
You must be joking.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Do you know who I am?
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
The LeSabre!
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I have... did it sound that bad?
So, call me when you --
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
What're you doing here, Roy?
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
How did you know?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
What are you doing?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
The Five?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
What are those for?
Looking for someone?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
What do you mean?
Could you give us an example?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Like what?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Joyce was screwing Del.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
That was a really shitty thing to do.
How'd they describe her?
I'm not telling.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
What doesn't?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Who's this?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Devil his due.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
...Yeah?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
It's bona fide!
Come back here, kid!
Why?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Good morning, girls.
Joe!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Where are you from, boy?
Louder!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Yes I do!
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
I vote for the motel.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Want me to get a towel?
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
You okay?
That isn't true, is it?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
What if she called the cops?
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
He said open it.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
They're coughing.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Ever read any Poe?
No, Edgar Allen.
478...
What do we do?
What if they get in here?
Nope.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Got him!
What are you doing?
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Alma I told you to...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Lemme see that rifle son...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
What the fuck?
Get out of the car.
Inspector Brimmer
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
...Glad you came man.
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
C'mon let's...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
What's the pig's name?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Fuck is up?!
My Mom's at that.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Rose?
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
When?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
I know that.
You're surrendering.
What unit?
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
What news?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
What now, sir?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
It is ended.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Thank you.
How many came back?
Not yet, Thomas.
Put those away.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Yes.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Is he really all right?
Because you promised.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
What were you listening to?
Nice.
I can hardly read these.
Yes, but--
What say, Louis?
I'm not climbing that.
Almost there, Louis.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
There's ... another exit?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Do you believe him?
I'll drop it!
The curse drove you to gather this?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
If I had known --
Come on!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
You would do that?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Where does it make berth?
Agreed.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
No.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
I think he's telling the truth.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
How long do you leave him in there?
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
How apropos.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Consideration?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Yeah, I do!
Yeah?  So what?
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Yes?
What's it smell like?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
Yeah.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
You don't know?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Just like old times.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What's that?
You made this out of my hair?
Who is he?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Argon's private lab.
You saved my life.
We've got to get the nanobot.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Vermin...
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
I could have you fired right now.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
What do you want?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
I'm not going!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
That's an excellent idea.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
What do you want?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah.
It has been alleged - yes—
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
—Mr. Schuyler .
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Araby?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
No?
Who are you?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
The boss is getting hoarse.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
How far have you gotten?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Who was that?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
What other girl—?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Well, at best you might deny it.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Yes - the worm!
Heavens! The man's insane!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
You try it.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Found no skeletons?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
It's okay. It's alright.
And they won't be able to tell?
Having kind of a tough time.
Where'd you get this?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Sure you are.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
What?
But where would we go?
Sure is pretty.
Oh.  I can't.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
What happened?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
It's like the basketball team.
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Mr. Simpson ...
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Oh God.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Those are my friends.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
What's wrong?
You're reading?
No. I baked them for you.
Mmmmgh.
So what's it like?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
You want some berries?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
How much does it cost?
Hello there.
Look ...
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
How long do you think you've been here?
There's worse places.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
Yeah. TV busted?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Free?
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
...please, I just don't want it....
You look nervous.
Are you gonna do it?
Yeah I can't.
Why's it here?
Hey. What are you doing?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Yes.
Hi. This is Jack.
Where are you?
Sure.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Hello?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Who is it?
You like her?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
You see?
Oh that's great.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
This is Barry.
That was good.
I don't freak out.
Hello?
...what...?
Yeah.
How many times have you been on an airplane?
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Ok.
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I cut myself.
On my knife.
The police are on their way.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
What do you mean?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
No one will know your name.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
I'll say whatever I want --
Sorry about that.
Yeah.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
What's up?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
....now: this pudding?
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Yes.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
That's it.
What's the problem?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok. That's alright.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Has he hurt you?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
-- water! --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
It's no secret that you loved her.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
I'll do everything in my power --
He'll do no such thing.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
As for the author... shoot him.
But I am history.
I'll be waiting.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Did I frighten you?
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
They've taken your clothes?
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
I am eternally in your debt.
Good God, Marquise --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Doesn't that please you?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
There. That's right.
How bad is it?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Marion--
This picture--
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
There's a different between want and
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Keep filming.
I wanna see the picture today
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
But with compassion and insight--
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yes.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
I don't have it anymore?!
Why her?
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
The title?
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
What have I done?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
May I help you?
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
It came.
To do what?
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
It was the best, kid
Oh, no--
We're from...
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What's up, Colonel?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Where you going at this hour?
You're a good sport, lady.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Yeah --
With her? How?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What?
But you said "you."
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
Three more, I figure.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Can you see it?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
But, Jake, I was just...
Huh?
Where you been all day?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Open the door, Vickie.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How's the weight? Ok?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Name me a better photographer.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
His wife took a trip.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
She never left the apartment --
Who said they left then?
If possible -- both.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jewelry?
But I'm not a killer!
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Wrong day?
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Read some good books.
Hello.
Jeff --
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
I knew it!
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
A Federal offense.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
Thank heaven that's over!
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
What about the rest?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Who's Thorwald?
And you love life?
Anything else bothering you?
Something big going on somewhere?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Big enough?
What a day I've had!
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
So do I.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Yeah.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
We have all -- what?
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I'll rephrase the question.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
What's happening?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
What time is it?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Yeah!  Shh!
You awake?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Will you let him tell it!
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Isn't it crazy?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
What?
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
The kids take me.
Goodbye!  See you!
They'll be looking for you.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
I'm getting that way, too.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Oh, Jim!
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
You can't talk underwater!
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
What?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
No!
Is he your friend?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
That one?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Must have a way with stationery.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
You promised me!
I've been doing good, though.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
He working for them on this one?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Get your own room, Ashley.
I love you, Nick...
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
No, you can't --
You're not Nick Mason...
But you were saying you were...
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
What'd they call her in college?
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
The hell you don't.
We walked the place for a week.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Do I get a country-western name?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
That motherfucker --
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You knew there were guns in here!
Monsters in the gelatin...
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Oh.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Rudy, don't move --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Tell her... I'll be there ...
NO!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
That was my king!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
You fuckin' wish.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I'll call somebody.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
The Brewers.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
What for?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Aren't you?
I know.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Why?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Gun shot.
You really think we were set up?
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got the diamonds.
I got 'em, all right?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Who shot who?
Tell them to come on in.
It doesn't matter who they are.
This must have been in the family a long time.
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
You can't leave us here.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
What's the matter with her?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Are we leaving?
I won't have you fighting over me.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
Where you going?
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
How does she draw?
Who's Lednov?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Can I have my gun back?
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Stop it -- stop it.
That sure smells good.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
And you're all alone.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Go on. Have another try at him.
We might as well start a fire.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
How do you know who we are?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got company. Female company.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Me, too. 101?
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Ray, run faster.
I meant you're into ghosts.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, let me...
Listen to me I --
Are you okay?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
Noooo!!!
What the hell are you doing?
Father!
So, do you think you made it into the class?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
I can do it myself.
Hello Dwight.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
It's okay. I understand.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Hi, Mom.
Did you hear?
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
State your name, please.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
And who may I ask is Carl?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
That's like your car, Beverly,
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
What was that?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
When I wanted to.
No.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
What brought you down here, Greg?
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
No!
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
I have been at the library.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
What?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Would they hurt her?
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
I didn't know.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Yes.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
But she was here?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
That was quick.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
...free-lance. You know.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Mother, father, sister.
Would you mind?
Does it bother you?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Aren't you?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
Yes.
No.
What... what are these interviews about?
What about sex?
You just ask them questions?
To you?
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
That's a good question.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
No.
Yes.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I've told you.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But you're planning to be?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Don't do that.
I can't tell you like this.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Yes. I just got busy.
Something wrong?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I'm not either!!
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
I hate my sister.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Questions about sex.
Apparently.
What!?
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Here it is.
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
How did you find me?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Doing what?
About what?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
Then what happened?
Hello.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Do you want me to stop calling?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
One moment.
Mr. Millaney?
You knew these people?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Kiss, kiss?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
Yes?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
He didn't make it.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
I know, I know, it's just...
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
SIN-I-FUL
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
Mental instability?
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
But they only think they're happy.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
No!  He's never done that before.
I'm...happy.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
THAT MINIMAL
CRIMINAL
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
The fuck was that?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Is it chicken?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Anything I'd know?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Whoa, why are we getting off?
What?
How old's she going to be?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Nice, huh?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Where were you?
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
What'd Christine say?
Where is Stephanie?
Besides what?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
With Maya.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
What?
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Do you like them?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
What's that supposed to mean?
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Well?
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You know what I'm thinking?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Me?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Well. That about does it.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
You want to join us?
Hi.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Is she sleeping or...?
You got kids?
What's the title?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Maya.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
How much skin and stem contact?
So what do you think?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Where's Jack?
Huh.
See you, Miles. You take care.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
...Tell Graham --
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Explain, act crazy?
No I'm not.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
It's noise.
Where are you going?
They're on the roof.
This is going to do nothing.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
I'm getting out now.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
I can't even imagine.
Is anything missing?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
And three weeks.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
You must have known that before you came.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Jefferson City?
South of here, past Chimayo.
I gotta be going.
What's Turley like?
Doesn't look quite fair.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
Where is Rae?
Who?
That's a lie.
This a friend of yours?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Hello, Rae.
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I thought we talked about that.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
And I know what I'm talking about.
It's the only place I'm happy.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Is this a fair mix?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
-- It's called a projector.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Where is she?
Even the fall from the plane?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Hello?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
What I do to Simone?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
How will you do our love scenes?
Is she here?
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
-- We call them "vactors".
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Hi, Dad.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
You know me -- married to my work.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Why didn't she thank you?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
About you and mom?
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
It's a hotel.
You could play the lead.
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
I am the death of real.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Why, Malcolm?
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
I forgot your name.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
You want to ask me a question?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He hates me.
Yes.
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
...No.
Can I ask you then?
--What?
You weren't a paper champion.
Are you wigging out?
Just help.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
I don't know how else to look--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
...He doesn't get invited places.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
See?
Fuck you.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Looks like the alternator.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Well, there goes our record deal.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Sure. What do you want to know.
Throw me one.
Ow!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Shit!
Yes!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Is that right?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Wait a minute --
No Mac, please... I --
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Shit.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
No reception out here.
That wasn't a good night, no.
What?
What the hell are we going to do?!
What?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Looks like a chipmunk.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Where are you going?
I never danced in a towel before.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
You.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Kate McConnell.
Why're you driving so fast?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Who'd want to?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
So tell me about yourself.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Seriously?!?
Anything?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Hey...
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
I'm proud of you.
One to five?
What are you thinking?
Why should I?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
But you'll do it?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
How long's this gonna take?
Hit the brakes!
We still on schedule?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
I hate to say it...
Never mind. It's nothing.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
-- How we doing?
I'm all ears.
Bandit II?
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Bandit two, you read me?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
Is your security team armed?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Who?
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Man, that's great.
What happened?
D'you talk to'm?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
...I'm sorry...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...Yeah, fifty-three.
I wouldn't go that far.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Shoot.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- never in a million girl --
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Why?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What's wrong?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
I DON'T KNOW!
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Why would you let her to do that?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Not a very happy poem.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
What are you talking about?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
What's happening to us?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
He won't do it.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Uh...
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
I'm sorry about what happened.
He said he'd kill me.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Yeah.
You could do better.
Good night, Mike.
You told her?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
How long you going away for?
Claire!
I'll miss you, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're planning to speak?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
My ass if falling.
So how'd it go?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
She's got to identify him.
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What did you do tonight?
What did you watch?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
What about when she goes out?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
What about when she identifies him?!
At my house...!
You in this with me?
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
I asked for the man in charge...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
How do I know that's her?
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
What're we having?
How do you know where the gun is?
How are things going, pal?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Flash, drop it--
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
I hate--
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Toxic dumps, huh.
You sure about all this?
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
I'm a photographer, remember?
A match made in heaven.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
How much do you know about it?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
So they're airing this tonight?
You're sure you're all right.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Jawohl.
Ready?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
What is this? This is water?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
You want Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You did?
What do those broads say?
Do Grable.
You're crying, Animal.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
What are you going to do?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Why the south latrine?
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says me.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Right.
You taking Dunbar?
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
I'll kill you for that!
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
What guy?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
This is its current position.
Are any of them inhabited?
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
What?
Can you locate them?
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Close to retirement?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Sir?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Maybe they're not out there.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
The royal...studs?
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
I don't believe it...
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My God...
Why would you do this...?
The word, sir?
Count on our help, sir.
See! That shimmering area.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Close... There --
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Would you look at that?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
May I ask why...?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

Genesis, I want it.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
What I have done, I had to do.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Until now.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
You did this -- in a day?!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They won't --
No!
Well?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Genesis, what's that?
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We'll be going to warp speed --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Not enough against their shields.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
... the good of the few...
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Kirk here.
Yes.
Khan!
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Admiral on the bridge!
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Certainly...
I do this because I was there,
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Now wait just a damn minute.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Oh, joy.
An experimental device, doctor.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Status report, Admiral!
You mean man...
Thanks.
Then --
Where could you take them?
I'm all ears.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
So. There we are.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
You tricked me.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
I have no control, sir!
Systems report.  Communications?
What is it?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Any luck...?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
The explosive override -- ?
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Deceive us?
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
A perfect moment?
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Don't you ever get tired?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Won't he rust?
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
How many?
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
That's your expert opinion?
What's inside that nebula cluster?
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Deck five.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Come in.  Hi.
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Juice?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Captain, the Enterprise!
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Did you need something?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
We?
You're leaving, aren't you?
Life signs?
Captain...?
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Report.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
What the hell is happening, Worf?
Emergency override!
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Mr. President.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
What the Hell's going on?
Are we playing multiple choice?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Would you care to go topside?
Torpedo room--?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
An accident wasn't good enough...
How did you know...?
How much time's left of your sentence?
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Who is "US?"
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Me?
Captain...
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
But I am not human. I am only -
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
How did you - ?
Her own father...?
Any progress?
Sir?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Beverly, come in.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Yes.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Counselor.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
How can you be certain?
Imzadi. This is so good.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

I won't do it.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Sir --
It's working.
Strength in numbers?
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Praetor?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I don't know.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Report!
My God...
Are we prepared?
The bond is broken.
How many Warbirds will you need?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Benny, there's nothing there.
What do you think of America?
Where did you stop last?
Recognize this?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
I don't like it, George...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Hello George.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
No deal.
I just retired.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Please...
Steering wheel...
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Minneapolis... good.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Who are you?
No.
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
I will see it next time.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
But I must go here.
The driver will...
Well... I'm going to go now.
Goodbye.
The captain...
What are you doing?
I am not a good singer.
Put that back.
Are you angry at me?
I will go. But not you.
What are you saying?
You are cold.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
I love you.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
I don't know where he is.
They after you?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
We can't let you do that.
Yeah, that's right.
Bullshit politics.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Maybe.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
You alright?  Y'okay?
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Faith OK?
What stuff?
Jesus.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Are we having a bad night?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Forget her.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
No more, Lenny.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
No it doesn't.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
There's a plus side?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
What is that?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Have you had a chance to think about --
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Agent Mackelway.
Dylan here.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
I think I talked to him.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
How do you feel, Agent
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Why did you go to Chicago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
There was talk of a file photo.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Dick Low's a killer too.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
You are so fucked up.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Thanks for the ride.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Agent...
Unlock these cuffs.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
You have to put things in perspective.
Ever since I've known you.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Thanks.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Hi.
You haven't told then, huh?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Well, who represents you back east?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah, hold on.
I miss you, Mike.
Hi.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
Well that sucks.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Why?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I didn't mention her once today.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sounds more like Aids...
Thanks, man.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
Uuuuugh!
Pause it. 
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Hello?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
We're going to Vegas.
Wait.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas.
They're all skanks.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Double down.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Mikey's the big winner.
You think so?
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
No. Doesn't that suck?
Who? Rob?
...the Copa, in New York...
How you guys doing?
What are you doing?
We got the digits, baby.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Shut up, Sue...
...Okay, two...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
No.  You ask for too much.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Godfather!
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
You take care of Paulie?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
You take care of your family?
This morning.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
And this?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Corleone.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Mike!  The party starting!
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Will you give this to him.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Mike, why am I out?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
What time do they expect us?
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Michael?
He'll be OK.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
When will I see you again?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Send some bodyguards.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
Go on Mike.
What is it?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Buy me out?...
You straightened my brother out?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
You'd say if you mind?
Shut up.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I have to go to Venice.
You're breaking my ribs!
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
Do you have any brothers?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
He's downstairs.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Frederico!
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Hardly.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Dickie!
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie?
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I told you. He gave them to me.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Where's Dickie's father?
This is spectacular.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
You're kidding.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
What rumour?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Are you okay?
Do you want me to stick around?
Or Tom and Peter even.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Even her.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
It is a little coarse, yes.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
You want to canvass?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Where do you live?
The moon?
You know what you remind me of?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Where are you going?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Where.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your real name?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
God, you are square.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
What should I do? Call the cops?
What do you mean?
Also clean.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I'm hip.
Get it.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Stick with Carla.
I'll go.
What, vou?
Mason.  Mason?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
You'll stand by me?
You've got everything?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Dad?
That's my girl!  Did you...?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Whoa.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
What was that?
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Your dancing's very good.
What... do you remember?
Delly, shhhhhh...
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes it does.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Yes.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Wait'll you see the inside!
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Luke... what time is it?
Jesus...
Did I what?
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
Evening, Luke.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Not at all.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Tim, I have to tell you something.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Thank you.
San Francisco.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
I see.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Are you coming to my party?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Why are they trying to kill people?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
And the white house?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Daniels.
Yes.
How much for the phone calls?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Young woman cut herself.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Lovebirds, I see.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
In a bird shop.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
When?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother, get a rope!
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Where's Mitch?
Then he saw.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
That's the last of it.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Well, where did he go?
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Doesn't what make me...?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Some of them are.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
We never met in court or anyplace else.
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
So you're a lawyer.
Do you practice here?
Ouch!
Why... 
You like me, huh?
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Why did he shoot her?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Will I be seeing you again?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
So you didn't go to school together.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Melanie, Melanie...
Do you want to try your father again? 
Have we still got power?
Santa Rosa?
What time is it?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
There we are!
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
For what purpose?
How do you plan to do that?
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
You have his promise, then?
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You must leave this house.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
I don't think I can go on, sir.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
But this woman -- and her son --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
What do you mean, Fettes?
See that, Fettes?
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Are you a doctor, too?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
But what makes a thought start?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
She would if she could.
Crony indeed!
We won't.
Check and mate.
You think I'm crazy.
I was hoping you'd find out.
You lied at my trial.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
You're him. Corvis.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
Are you ok?
Erin. It's not your fault.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Are you ok?
What is it?
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No foolin'? Will you?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
I don't believe it.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
It was a wonderful day.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I want to know what he told you last night.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Hello.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
No -- no, thanks.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
I don't like horror comics.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Why not?
Should I run him through?
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Whattaya mean?
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
Where's Star, David?!
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Good!
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Sure.
We are...
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Tell them to get something to eat.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
He met a girl.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
You're cute, Max.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I am?
But you passed the test!
Are you following me?
Hi...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
I guess you're new around here.
Let's go see them.
Why not?
Huh?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Did you spill something?
I'm making you a sandwich.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Sixteen.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Now why'd you go and...
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
What?
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
What's happening?
MacReady!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
MacReady!
What are you doing?
We should have jumped his ass.
Spaceship of some kind.
I think so.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
I guess you're okay.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
Hey, man...!
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
How long's it been?
What's...
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
What if it doesn't come?
Maybe it ain't coming.
What's happened?!
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
The Hall of Books.
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
But you escaped.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes...
So, do we go on?
It's what they want you to see.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
Why?
So you take their best...
Now will you go?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You're late.
Well there's something new.
Talk away, Professor.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Alex, what is it?
We took a walk three days ago.
Alex... people are staring.
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I know that --
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Is he all right?
Yes.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I don't understand.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Yes... I suppose so.
Kalen...
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
And roosters.
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
"Eloi"?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
You know that's not true.
We'll see about that.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
We are not birds of a feather.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
My father used to talk about you.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
What should they be looking for?
This is really happening, isn't it?
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
I think I can remember what's on them.
I gave you my dog tags.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Do you really believe me?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
They're not here.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
How?
And if I didn't want to come?
My God you look exactly like him.
How'd he get it?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
What about the world?
Why don't you help me?
You told me this was how it happened.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You know how to get there?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
It's gonna be sticky.
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
You ever been to jail?
Can you drive?
I'm not sure.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, how'd you get here?
No.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
Darryl.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Who's the nut?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Who do you think did it?
No!
Armed robber.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Stop.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, I guess I'd better...
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Who did it?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Thelma!
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Exactly.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
He's got a lot to be proud of.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
You think you've found your calling?
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Now what?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
What?
Ready?
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
What?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
No.
We can live in a hacienda.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
What in the hell is it?!
We been seein' you all along the way.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
I'm asking you to leave.
Gay? He said you were gay?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
It must be great with a wife like that.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
And this adversely affects me how...?
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Very nice.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
I work with retards.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
A surprise?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
I guess.
Are you okay?
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Hey, hey, hey!
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Among others.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Friend. Baseball bat.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh... Sully.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
So who's the lucky guy?
Good lookin'?
What's a mook?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Pat does projects all over the world.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Can I pour you one?
What's up?
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
The prom -- you going?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Are you all right?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
By the way, how's he doing?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Twenty-two.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Please leave.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
No! I was pissing!
See you, Warren.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
The other thing is...
Oh, still sore about this.
My father --
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
When are you going to be home?
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
How's my favorite President?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
So what've we got today?
Should be here any minute.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Let's get out of here.
I don't like what's happening.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What's this about?
Who are you?
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Couldn't sleep.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Tread matches. It's the car.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Jesus, you alright?
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
That's not solid.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Still after Jimmy?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
This Clear Moon's house?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
X22. Read.
Ray...
Do you want a coffee?
What ya want?
That's a big comfort to me.
The what?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I can't.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
What about the plane?
Does it bother you?
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Come on.
You want to go ballistic?
And now I want you.
I want it understood.
Well no...inverse order.
You ever fly an F-14? 
That's not what I hear.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I want it back.
What do you do when you come here?
What kind of games?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
Want to play the game?
Looks like a tie.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I know exactly what you mean.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
This is crazy!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
You're not supposed to...
Well, I don't know. That depends.
The list is long, but distinguished.
So I've heard.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
We did it!
It's a victory roll.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
I'm pinned to the panel.
That's Kazanski.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
A plaque?
No, we...got our butts kicked.
Hear about Ice?
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
Who is the best.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
I've seen this before.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
You won?!!!
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
I can take care of myself.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
Or you can quit.
You may not think so, but you are.
First time on Mars?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
What happened to them?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What do you want?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I'm with an very important client.
So, been married long?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Pull them out.
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Hey, Quaid!
I want that fucker dead.
Where is he?
Shit!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Who?
...You mean it?
Lori...
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
And falling in love?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Doug...Bob McClane.
Right.  Mars.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
Go on.
...What?
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
This is too weird.
Forget I said wife.
So you dropped by to apologize?
I don't need Kuato for that.
Where are you going?!
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
What the hell is that, anyway?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Prairie dog burrow...
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
We playing cards tonight?
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Down, honey, down.
What?
Well, what's wrong with it?
Twenty.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Ms. Vin's sister.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
What other case?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
So what're we gonna do?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
-- What?
...Jesus!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Murder witness.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
My mother find you?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
No.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Five years.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
What color hair will she have?
Tell me some other things about her.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
OK, Gordon.
Phillip?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
A blue rose.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
You better dust this place, Sam.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Nice night.
Bob.
The pages are gone. That's real.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
This afternoon?
What's going on?
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Who was that?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
What's wrong?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
What is the truth?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
That's not my handwriting.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Orthopedics?
How old are you?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I am seventy-four years old.
Dr. Gruber...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Thank you...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
What did she say?
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Listen to me, fella...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Really. How wonderful for you.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
Do you think it's my fault?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Mr. Galvin's...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
I have to talk to you.
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
Who have we got?
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
What happened, Joey...?
How are you holding up?
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What the hell are you doing here?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
...of the procedures...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Did it do you any good?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
The troops are certainly moving in here!
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
They've blocked it!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
We will, sir!
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
You mean that was a...
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Guess so.
Heather?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Doctor...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
I want my kid out of here now!
What?
Time for sleep.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
And...what's the man doing?
Home.
You okay, champ?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
When do you think it'll be done?
What...happened?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
You're not crazy, by the way.
You didn't jump in.
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
Heather Langenkamp?
Studio B.
I'm sorry, I can't.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Captured?  How?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
No, not really.  I...
Uh...sure...when?
Did we lose anybody?
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Come in.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
Where's Mom?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
Ninety-six.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Feels different doesn't it?
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Why'd you do it?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
How ya doing?
So... What happened?
It was so real...
Yes, sir.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
But you invited is aboard.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
What is it we can do for you today?
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
What?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Suicidal...
No, sir.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Swing up, son.
What's it going to be?
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
No.
For killing a dolphin.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Easy for you to say.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Y'all take American Express?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
This your car?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
What is it?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Oh, many things...
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
What's that honey?
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
Actin' funny how?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
How much we got left, honey?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Trust me on it.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
He's the kind liked it.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Course I am, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Have it your way... But you want it.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Where?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Put your shoulders back.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
I just mean...
He has a book.
Not Curtis.
That was good.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
How bad is it for you?
Crabtree.
Who do you think it is?
So whose car is it?
Naturally you have copies.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
You driving this car?
I passed out.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
I know.
Who's got a gun?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Is that really it?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh.
Want me to get that?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
How's that?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
Isn't this...?
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
I'm sorry.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
It's because you don't eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Near Carvel?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Yes, Hannah?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Professor Tripp.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Oh?
Someone stole my car.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what did you say?
I'm through improvising.
I know.
You don't deserve me, you know.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He's writing his name in water.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Grady?
Oh?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
And?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
There's so many...
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Five years.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
What's happening?
I've got some good news.
It's not what you think.
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
See anything interesting?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Have you seen Walter?
Yeah, like the bird.
I'm twelve.
Walter.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
No.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
You don't like coming here, do you?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Why do you think you're here?
Is that what you are angry about?
You couldn't say.
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do they know?
I want to be normal!
You don't know!
Close your eyes.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where?
How old are you and your sister?
What the hell are you doing there?
Don't ever do that again.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
What else?
You felt pleasure.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
I'm talking about you.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
You plan to drink both those beers?
What about bears?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
So, you're not a dyke.
Is that all?
Sorry.
It's not what you think.
You mean the time you're locked away?
They seduce you?
And what do you tell yourself now?
You know, this is crazy.
I love my brothers.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
What's this?
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Lord Almighty.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
What happened?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Did you find Wilhite?
Do we just leave him there?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
'Fish'?
Y'all could be more specific.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
4800 feet.  It's official.
He can still make it.
Did you sleep well?
Which one shall I wear?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Have you decided?
Somebody must live here!
Find anything?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Any news?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
That's why I asked you...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
I'm too sleepy.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Who are you talking to?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Looks like the weather is changing.
I'll stay here also.
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
And what are we going to do now?
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Where is she going?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
And what did they say about me?
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
And how come you're up so early?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Your mother?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
I would like to ask you something.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
No.
Yes.
No.
Because...
I'm not hungry.
No I don't... the host is enough.
I'm being punished.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Should you see a doctor?
You have a lovely voice.
No I'm not.
And you like that?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I went to my room.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Do you have any children?
What else did she tell you?
Like what?
You have trouble sleeping?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
What the child?
But you're troubled... aren't you?
What did you do?
She's dead isn't she?
She can't hurt you any more.
How does she know that?
You're a mistake.
I really love you.
And why am I here?
Of telling you.
To be a mother?
No.
Yes.
Of what?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Do you remember what just happened?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Stay away from me...
For what he made me go through.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was dead.
She took the baby in her arms?
What did you do?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Martha, it's you.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
All I want is one more week.
No, no, no...
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Yes.
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
And you didn't try to find out who?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
Who?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm only interested...
???  
I am...
What?
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Visitors to the convent.
There's nothing here.
Like keeping her home from school?
And my permission?
Bullshit yourself!
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Even Christ would partake socially.
Do you want to become one?
I'd like to begin.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
Don't be ridiculous.
That's what I have to believe...
Somebody told her.
The baby?
You wanted that child out of the way.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Lay them down.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
What about all these letters?
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
We're nearly there, sir.
Are you going in?
Me? Why?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
What's up?
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Oh!
Are you pulling my leg?
They ought to be.
Pity.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
What are they saying?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
That'll keep you busy.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Anything to spare?
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
That little old man.
Let's go and muck in.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
What's he know?
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Now get on with it.
Let's have you.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
That's what you tell me.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
That's mine.
What?
How's that?
Oh... God... am I cold...
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Any rotation?
Gravity?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
This is Chaz.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Don't you remember?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Yes?  What is it?
Why, what's wrong?
You like this shit?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened to the lights?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
Now we're in for it.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
What common objects?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Recognizable!  In that?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
This looks ancient.
That sounds a little fanciful...
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
How?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
Yeah, okay. 
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
This ship is full of cat hair.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Here, Chaz.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
We won't need it then.
Where are you?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
Better?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Seal everything now!
How many of them are there?
Where is she?
I found it...
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Where're they headed?
It's too late!
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Listen to what?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Alright, okay.  Look...
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
What is that?
Seltzer?
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
May I come in?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
What a day - what a heavenly day...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
She was a liar, she was a liar!
That's not true!
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't think I'm going.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Good luck, genius...
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Take care of yourself out there...
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Knit me a muffler.
Then you're crazy.
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
I will not calm down!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
It's not nonsense.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Yes, dear.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Why?
Why what?
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Yes. Yes, it does.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
The same size?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Birdie-
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
What are you doing here?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's the door.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
He can help you.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
What - again?
I've got it.
I'd like to hear it.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
What about Bill?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
I remember.
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Well of all-
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
How about calling it a night?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Who's left out there?
When you do, let me in on it.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
To you, too?
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
I don't think I could be.
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
Play it again.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
When's the audition?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
What's that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
See her?  Get anything?
Did he just say what I think he said?
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
Morning or night?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hey... very tense.
I think.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
Something maybe big.
Who by?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
But they both worked at the White House?
What happens when the baby comes?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--I saw him. He verifies.
I got Clawsen on hold--
We can't talk inside either?
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Go on.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Are you sure?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
...go on, go on...
Who's Colson, Harry?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
Does "they" mean the White House?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
What did you just say?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Me too.  For the most part.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
What's your middle name?
Come on!  I won't tell.
Nice car.
What?  No I'm not.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
You want onions?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
I think I've had one.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
You got it, stud.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
And you said...
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Did I miss anything?!
But, but -- what would I do?
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yes dad.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Dad.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
This'll do.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
I still think you're okay.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Yes.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Tonight?
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Hey...
Now?!
Yeah.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
That was a great night.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
...Guess what?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
That junior chick?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Here, babe.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Sure. I can follow that.
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Fan-fucking-tastic?
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Serafine...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What the fuck!? You too!?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
God. I can't believe it.
Whoa...
The ADM. Let's go.
Nothing's happening!
We know you were with her.
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Uncle Terrence?
Where is it! Please!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Why would he pick this one?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Shit. I feel sick.
Andy!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
What've you got?
What did she say?
Saint Severin...
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Who did you hear it from?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Every Russian family has one..
No! Well, yes, but
Do you remember this?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
See? The Princess is under there ...
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I did no such thing!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Who's on television?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
You're like New York. You're an island.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Allison.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Two minutes, Alvy.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Alvy, I...
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Hi. Hi, hi.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
For yuh.
All right.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
No, I got time.
Fifteen years?
Sylvia Plath.
Oh, sorry.
God bless.
Oh, thank you.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah?
And we'll digest our food better.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Hey?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
That's the key question.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
How is it any different?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
M'hm.
You're so sure about it.
Yeah.
Well, what is your definition of following?
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
What's- It's me, open up.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Two?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Yeah?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Yeah, but it's real close.
Here's a real present.
Check it out.
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
That's sick!
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Christ!
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Oh, you got a headache!
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Just give me the license, please.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
I have some very good memories there.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
Well, sit down.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
The one with the V.P.L.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, gosh.
Did you know the contractor?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
What's that?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
What what's about?
I'm not.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Thanks for coming.
Can I open it?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Just did.  Jealous?
Are you my big hard hero?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Go.
I'm fine, babe.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Accept a compliment.
What did you get me?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
It's an unfair advantage.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
I don't look my age, Joe.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Panes!  How are you?
Coffee?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Joking.
And I you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
I meant Sally.
Easy tiger.
Scout's honor.
I need to leave you now.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
I think there are sixteen there.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
I don't need a drug.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
What?
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I'm sorry.
I...
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
The charades.
The Shostakovich.
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
How?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Well, something's wrong.
What did I do?
I didn't know you had this.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
And you are...?
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Worker!  Come back here now!
We're going to die!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
And only you can become a Queen?
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Z!  Over here!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
...Not enough food?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
May I cut in?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
What do you see out there?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Good night.
You mean tonight?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Eight-thirty.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
What gave you that idea?
I forgive you.
One more?
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
Here.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Who?
And where are you now?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I don't want it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Cut.
Why not?
Do I have to?
You sure you want to throw that card?
I would.
There's a call for you --
Are you all right?
Here.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
To me?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Sir?
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Now you're being bright?
On account of me.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Good evening, Baxter.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
That so.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Family?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
I don't believe you.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
Remember what we talked about?
You're not being funny.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I have that date -- remember?
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Are you there, Fran?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Where are you headed?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Who the hell are you?
How about a drink ?
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
Yeah.
Holy shit.
How?
And the grass?
Who's he?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Flood.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Get in there !
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
They nail him for it bad ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What does that mean ?
Touchy.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Who is he?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I thought he was a lame.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Captain?
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
They far enough?
The wind --
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Why did you come to ... my province.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
I think think a lie stinks.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
And you admired him?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Were you with him, when...
Are you finished surfing?
This one , Lance?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
What's this tiger shit?
The other one --
Captain Willard?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
134  CONTINUED:
95   CONTINUED:
119  CONTINUED:  
...I won't let a killer walk!
39   CONTINUED:
Oh.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
That's not what I meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Let's go.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Leave it here.
Ben Corbett?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Does he have people?
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Told you I'm fine!
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
What's wrong?
Alleged killer.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
Why the smirk?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Go easy.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
You hear me?  Ben?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Do you love me?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Uh, Udall?
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
Okay.
Nice of you... thank you.
The stiff one eye?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Hi.
Thanks, Melvin.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
And mean it...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
You don't owe me that.
Sex with Simon?
How you doing?
Cute.
Because...
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
No!!!
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What the heck do you mean?
Help!
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
What?
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
No, I didn't.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Would you leave now, please?
Did you like it that much?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Why?  What happened?
You can't --
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Okay.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
What?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Is this how it went, Nick?
A player?
What?
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
You want me to pump?
An assassin?
Someone hired both of you?
He wants to kill you?
He was... taken.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
I was just different.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Because you are a women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
They become complicated... messy.
Do you have a passport?
About?
That's where he'll be.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
You should knock.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
What?
I told you, he will.
I don't believe that.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Yes.
Attraction is a complication?
Who was she?
Uh-huh.
Martin.
For what?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Right.
Some.
Why didn't you fade?
This will take some time.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
What are you having?
Cheers Katka!
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Oh yeah, what's that?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
That stinks!
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
No, why?
I'm an idiot?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Perfect!
We're going to need it all.
So why didn't we?
Like a hand?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Huh?
Now you're using that word.
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Yeah, no problem.
Take this exit.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
We should be done by the weekend.
Turned Czech huh?
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
But we could go to London and live in England.
Forget about me Kat.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Okay?
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
What would you like, beer?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Run into Josh?
Better than you.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
This is your doing?
And you broke into that room?
Really!
I'm not sure it's possible.
Would you like your things now?
Hey Doug, where you been?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Sure!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
It's more than what you're worth.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
She's coming over here...
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
You saw him?
A late night or an early morning?
Were you with Jamie?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Deranged.
Who are you?
You.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
This play -- ?
I'm an enemy?
I'll take a chance.
Like you'd know.
I'll get something for us to drink --
Because I try to be nice to people?
Saturn. Beautiful.
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
He doesn't trust you.
Oh. Just not at school...
People can see.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
I might do it wrong.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Jamie --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I've talked to your father.
How you doing?
How're you doing?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
You've been well?
Now I can do what I want.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
So what did we just make?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
'Bike fine point?'
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
What?!
Eight thirty.
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
A gold mine?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
An atomic bomb.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
You didn't?
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
What year is this?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Suzy!
Hi. where's Cato?
How you doing, Cato?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What'd they look like?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
We did it, Ray.
Then why'd you do it?
Sure is pretty.
What for?
No, you're not either.
Nothing.
Hi.
You're a redhead.
My stomach's growling.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Is that all there is to it?
I can look and see.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Think I got 'em?
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
No.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
What?
Have you got a better idea?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Hi.
Hi, whatcha doing?
Fine.
You didn't walk out here.
Think I'll take the juice?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
There's another one we owe 'em.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Planet 10?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
You're a welcome sight...
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Got a casualty list?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Pictures don't lie.
I see.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well... THIS.
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
What do you mean, Barton?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
You're leaving?
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
So they say.
Why don't we go to your room-
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Jesus... You're leaving.
It's okay... It's okay...
Sure, Charlie.
...Where did we put him?
...Yes, thank you.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
L.A.P.D.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Big fuckin' deal.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Yes, Colonel.
There's no smoking in this building.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Take care, you hear?
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
So -- how are things?
How is your -- personal life?
How about the coke?
We were in some of the same classes.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
Did you go home with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
How did you feel when he died?
But you didn't hurt --
Because you didn't love him --
Even though you were fucking him.
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
My wife used to call me that.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
What did you think?
How's your shoulder?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
You're in over your head.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What kind of drugs?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Was she ever a suspect?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
I never heard of him.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Were you with him last night?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Fuck you, Phil.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
Why do you think he's dead?
Yes I did.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Is this finished yet?
When's your show?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
New York.
It's in New York.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
What are they?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Would you like to see the wine list?
Paint it out.
– In this corner?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Blue? Where?
You're shattering all my myths.
Your people.
Good.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
She's good.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Guess I just got sick of him.
You do! You definitely do.
Do you know what he's saying?
You're back.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
It's cold.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Pouring myself into my work.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Alfred, are you...?
Please be looking for me.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Watch the first step.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Umm-hmmmm.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
The dreams again, sir?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
It'll never work.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Why do I keep doing this?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
All the answers are numbers.
Letters in the alphabet.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
La'chiem.
To kill me.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't-.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Chase?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Go ahead. You can say it.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Thank you, Vicki.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
No.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
All street mimes should be executed.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Where does one man get all this junk?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
HOLY SHIT!!
There aren't hotels?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Hi,
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Goodnight Annie.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Oh yes.
And howls Alison?
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Maybe two cars.
Welsh.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Shut up, Kevin.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Well where is she?!
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
She sure does.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I don't know what that signal means.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
W... What is it?
Your qu...?  But you're...
He's your cousin.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
What do you think, honey?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Where is your mother?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Stepmother's...
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
... Were you going somewhere?
He does, does he?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... Do you think we should look for him?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
I hope you're comfortable.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I would like to watch television.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
He does...?
Your leg must be getting better.
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
What is that?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes, it is very good!
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
No, Ben.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Does it have a television?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
I have no claim, Thomas.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
... How are the kids getting along?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Good night.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
This is not what I requested.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Why aren't you at work?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
Tell her you need to see her.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You fell in love with her first.
People make mistakes.
Maxine...
Holy shit, yes!
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Who told you?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
What'll you have?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
I’m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Hi.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Lotte? Is that you?
Vegas? What'd you think?
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
When?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
How do we do that?
What's the play?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Is there dancing?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
You still know.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Your mother all right?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
She gone like they say?
You grown.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Be here. In case.
No. I mean work work.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
Should I wake her?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
Mama let me help you.
I know Denver.
Can't locate him.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
This is our concern, Dude.
Uh-huh.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Hey, man, I'm not--
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
What do you mean, Dude?
Sheesh.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Burkhalter.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
No, they--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Heh-heh--
Yes, heh--
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Take it easy, Dude.
"Johnson"?
Yeah, but my-
From who?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
What happened to your house?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Yeah, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Have it your way.  The point is--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
FUCK.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Yeah.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Yeah.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What's mine is mine.
It's a heart attack.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Employed?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What?
Why?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Where to first?
how long since he was bitten?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Thank you.
You don't want to go there.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Why do you hate us so much?
How do you feel?
What do you think?
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
We're locked in.
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Stupidity.
Going somewhere?
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
You shouldn't be here.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
But he's a policeman --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
What are you looking at?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
Is he sick?
You care about him, don't you?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Any progress?
You don't look so good.
Is it bad?
Get out of here --
No --
You don't have to be.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
We keep in radio contact.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
--and if she ever did--
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
What do you mean?
What, are you alright?
What're you doing there?
'Thought those all got stolen.
What's she look like?
Yeah, so?
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
I want to see something!
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
I don't think it was them.
Does it hurt?
So lemme see it.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
No fucking.
What're you, crazy??
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
English.
Fire escape??
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Boy Kurth.
What the fuck--??
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
That's a "j."
Who?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
How're the cameras doing?
What--
What?
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Oooh. Oooh.
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
Elly Kedward?
What?
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
Heather.
"It's why the witch kills children."
What the fuck's going on here?
Why?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Thanks, Meurice.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Where... where you going?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Well... the couch would be all right...
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Uh-huh.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
...That's what's important.
...What's going on with you two?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
...So what're you doing tonight?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
Now that don't make much sense.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
You want me to kill 'em.
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
Dead, huh?
...What did you do with the bodies?
Pour that back.
Is Marty here?
Where was I?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Anything you can tell me?
What color is it?
Okay?
Is Sandy part of this?
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
Can I feel 'em?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
THEN WHAT?
Thank you. honey.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Hi. can I come in?
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Who, Dorothy?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
Heineken.
Yeah, how did you know?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I've gotta go in.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
So. what's next?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay. be careful.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Really?
... Sandy?.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Would you like a piece of cake?
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Blanca, por favor.
Nothing like this back home.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Nothing like this back home.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Tuna, this is crap.
Excuse me?
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Goodness.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
I know.
Touche.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Derek Foreal.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
Mexico.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Hello.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Pablo said no?
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Alright.
Where are you going?
No, that's alright.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Yeah.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
I don't know.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
There's schools in California.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Yeah?
Are we good?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
What "group"?
How much are they paying you?
What ... What must I decide?
Can you read?
No, and neither were my men.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Are you ready, colonel?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
You did a good job, Charlie.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
I think I'm going to make your day.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Objection sustained.
Objection, Your Honor.
Can you?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
She's innocent.
I've got work to do.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Tell the court about that, please.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What did she say?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
October twenty-seventh.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.
Where did you meet him?
Then what happened?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What happened?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I suppose.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Who told you that?
No.
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Are you going to represent me?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
-- And then?
Hi, Frank.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What's that for?
You don't need anybody.
I'm dropping the case.
Hello?
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
If you want me to.
What's she like?
She sounds like quite a woman.
What's wrong?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Eeeww!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Grateful!?
What are you doing?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Bar across the street.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Not yet. You want to go?
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Roseman Bridge?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
No, really?
So, how long you've been living here?
Oh there you are.
Oh, that's nice.
Lemon?
Where are you staying while you're here?
He's very... clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why did you stop?
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
You drink bug repellent?
Smells like dirt.
So what happened?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But no one in particular.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I'll pick you up.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Can I help?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I bet you could do a book.
You're somewhere else, where?
Where was she?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Stop it!
What do you want me to say?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
I don't know. Please...
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Don't feed that dog.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Died there?  How?
Hey, kid.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You want us to move in here?
Where's the others?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Aren't you going to join us?
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Lucky thing.
And you believe her?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
You got the cash?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Did you do it?
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Nice rack.  How old is --
That's all we did, steal their ride.
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Not really to live, just to play.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
How the fuck can I open it?
We're family, Caesar.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
I didn't expect --
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
They were early.
That doesn't make any sense.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
It's not here, Caesar.
I saved you.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We were in a car accident --
But everybody is all right.
Now that's teamwork.
You know he would have done you, too.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
So this is temporary for you?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Caesar is your husband?
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Okay, one drink.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
You mean Shelly?
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
It's in a case, on his desk.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Where will you be?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
What if he sees you?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
okay, all right.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Yes.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
-- he went inside! --
What do you mean?
What do they want me to do?
So now you know.
That's all I get?
Keep it. 
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so you're a victim.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
You knew he was coming.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
He run away often?
What the hell're you talking about?
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
xxxxxx...
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Out of kindness.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
How could you do this to me?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Why not?
What's going on here?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Look at that - right on time.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
He is dead.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Sam!!! 
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Er, don't you want to search me?
But I could be anybody.
what? ... Oh ... 
I mean it fixed itself.
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
No, no, that's impossible.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
What about Kanita?
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Okay, what happened?
IB Bangin.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Here, you try.
Is there any chance?
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I think this place stinks.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Five years.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
This is not a good time.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
Who's that?
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
The family know?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
The brakes are shot.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
I don't like being handled.
No.  Don't worry about it.
You packing up tonight?
Hold it down, okay?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
That's your full name?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
No.
Then what was good about it?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
What?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Ready.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What did he say?
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
...good-bye then.
What?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Why so glum?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Hi.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
They said it would be okay if...
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
You okay?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
It's not important.
No.  Were you going to you?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
So what did you think?
It's incredible who's here.
At least kiss me when you do that.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Hello?
Okay.  Good night.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
You're saying stay away from him.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Not even a little bit?
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
Oh yeah?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...stay away from me!
It was.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man this is heavy!
You...made that?
Yeah.
You didn't mean to what?
It's hot in here...
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Police officer.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
You're gonna shoot me!
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
I don't think so Mayolia.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
I look horrible.
Booo!
It's coffee.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Yes.
Wheels?
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
What's Bobby gonna say?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Hey there.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
I am a God!  A God!
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Dress, huh?  What for?
I crashed your party.
That's me.
I'm going out the front.
Are you okay?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Beverly Center.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
I was a slave.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Wait a minute.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Not a pressing issue.
Sporting events, yeah.
No -- you don't have to --
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
Put your head back.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Five?
Watchers?
I'm curious, is all.
I want to die.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Wait!
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That is so cool.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Omniplex?
What happened?
You're kidding.
Buffy!
The homelesses?
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Death is like spring training?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
It's Skip, for you.
Well I guess this is it.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I don't dance.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Damn.
Your place or mine?
He' s confused--
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Why baseball?
I don't know if I'd go that far.
Annie---
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
He's a good student.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
I didn't spit on you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
What do I got?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Can I ask you something?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
I was great, eh?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm trying to thank you.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
You're a great catcher.
No.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Step outside, pal.
No way.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
He walked eighteen?!
Struck out eighteen...
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Eight and twenty-four.
What the hell's going on out there?
Ain't here.
Well, I'd rather not say.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Oh, good.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
When did this happen, honey?
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Okay, Sammy.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
What?
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
You think he got the point?
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
Yes, you lost your control.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
What - what, Caesar's?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
No problem.  Sorry.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
You've got to stop her.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
...position...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
...and she doesn't always -
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
This woman's an institution.
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
...pit bosses, floor managers.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You all right?
Oh, it's so soft.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Huh?
You didn't have to beat him up!
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
Yes, I - yes, I do.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
With the money.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
I put her to bed.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Oh, sh-
Fuck you.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I want you to let me go.
Now you need approval from him to go home?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Well...
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
When I left here with the money...
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You gotta go back out there.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Hey!
All right. Okay, okay.
Come on. I'm sorry.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Of course, Remo.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Fine.
Hi, Jennifer.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
He gives a fuck what I do?
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
You fucked with me for the last time!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
...same outfit.
Yeah.
Do you know that?
...all the luck in the world.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
We'll go later.
Right.
He was just on the phone.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Charlie M?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I'm positive.
My fuckin' head.
Take it easy, though.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Yes, uh...
The crowd bought it.
You know, nobody likes you...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You're kidding.
I've been looking for you.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
What's the catch?
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
For when the time comes..
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Good morning.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Nothing. How's your hand?
Like you don't know...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Okay, deal.
Don't sneak up on me...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
You seem sad, Spooky.
Who's on the phone?
Say something ...
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Let's have your license, mister.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
You never miss a trick.
You switched license plates?
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
I don't want to know --
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
What makes you say that?
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
"Theo?"
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
You were at the Emerald that night?
I'm still okay.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Naturally.
You're making it too easy.
Pass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
308-9962.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
You should've done all this before.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Who's this?
We're gonna get there first.
Seems not.
I already called for an ambulance.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
I thought so.
The 405 is coming up.
Scottish?
It takes all types.
He gave me a look.
Just cut his hair, you know.
He agreed that he was.
He's still looking, Col.
Don't be like that --
See, they get the wrong idea.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
What was that?
Why?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Jesus Christ!
Someone out there.
He was different.
No.
Are you jealous of him?
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Can't leave me now.
Even now.
Tell him it hurt --
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Don't ask me in.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
So I got it wrong, then.
She from Scotland too?
Why?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Don't call me that --
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I had to go to work!
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Died...
You didn't.
You tried.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Love me.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
She was --
Meet Col --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Lucky you.
What was it?
Do you now.
Hey -- what's he like?
Leave us, Judie.
Leave her out of this.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Perfect.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
You sure about that?
And what's she like between the sheets?
Hope not.
Fuck you.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
How did you know it was her?
What's that?
No?
C'mere.
No?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Can't.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Having two pints in the Rock.
Who's Dil?
Oh, yeah.
Do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
She can't help it.
Don't think that way.
See if she's all right.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Don't.
What?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
I said you bastard -- stop --
The teddy bear?
Don't run off, Jude.
Not here.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
All right -- where's the letter?
Adam!
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Where's that airlines bag?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Yes, you told me.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- listen to me!
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Ours.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Why not?
No, what?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Starting with his own.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Very pretty. Now what?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Your --
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
What are you doing?
Who told you to do that?
Or Tex?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Reggie -- open the door.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
No -- not yet.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Up there! It is up there!
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Good for you.
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
Come on. You can't stay here.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
En garde.
Who said?
I wasn't --
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But why do you want a divorce?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah?
Why?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
She's my daughter, Tom.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Hi honey.
A little.
You know her?
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
What happened?
Well?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Really?
I know where you're going.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Yes.
You're the killed.
Mark Shale.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
No!
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
You ok?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
This place is empty.
Don't you think it's sick?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
Are you coming to the party?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
What?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Yes.
You ok?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You're so beautiful.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.

A little early for a delivery.
Where's Sam?
Great. 
...moron.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
I need your truck.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...town. 
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, no, no.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
You stole this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
...fine.
...-damn!

What?

Okay!  All right!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...let live.
Come on, old...
...Shift.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
That's right.  Now,  move!

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Pete.  Come on.
Whoo!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
Hang on!


No.  Shit.
 Aw, shit  
 Listen!  Listen...
He's crazy!
Keep still.
Oh, shit!


...shit.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
A-And you  owe me...
 

They're takin' off.
Hey, just shut up.
Arlo, shut up.
Yeah.
Come here.
We!
And Brynner's right on...
Okay...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
What the hell?
Shoot me. 
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Hang on, hang on.
What'd you come back for?!
 Well.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Thank you very much.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
...us.
I feel faint.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Hey.
Be cool.  Be--
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
So you called the damned thing Elvis
You got a prob-...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
What?  Say again...
We've got it...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
Doc-...
...-lar.
...-bility.
Now listen to me.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.

...-ple.
...and the government.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.

This is it.

Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
It's clean.
This was supposed to be a...
I wanna patch in from...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
Right.  Tim Mason.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
....-lene.
Assumptions are always...
I beg your pardon?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
...-tainer!

 


I would've in another life.
...-time,  remember?
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
 Two pots of coffee...
Ah.
No sign of 'em...
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Is Elvis out?
What the hell are you talkin' about...
A man named Tim Ma-...
...like a fish.
...is a perfect hunter.
...back...
...without caution...
...fishin'.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
You're the only one I can trust.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
...you, Mason?
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...


Oh.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
We worked in Chinatown together.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Why is that funny?
Yes, his girlfriend.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
How do you do that?
How much are you worth?
...No...
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
How do they do that?
Hello, Jake.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
It's too late.
That's it?
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Not that Mulwray?
Would you like something to drink?
That's not his apartment.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
No. I went riding rather early.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
My husband.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
What are you thinking?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
It was in Chinatown.
Working for the District Attorney.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
What about it?
Where?
Where are you going?
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Yes.
Did you get some sleep?
Upstairs. Why?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
That's good. Now what's her name?
I said I want the truth.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Yeah, Sophie.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Do you know me?
The water.
Yeah.
Come again?
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Of course not.
Then go home and forget about it.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
They were partners.
What's that, pal?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
You're still beautiful...
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
How long's it been shut?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Three cents.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Is it good?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I intend to find out.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
You've got some on your face.
You're very easily amused.
Oh!
Where's the towel?
Thanks.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
How old did you say you were?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Is that what you want to do?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Raymond - 
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
First of all - 
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
All right.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
What check?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
What's this?
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Yeah, all in crates.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
How long have you been smoking?
Fifty-five.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
I'm not pregnant.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I'm giving him his ring back.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Then who operated the store?
That's easy to say from over here.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
So?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
She called me Brad.
Allan Harris.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
How do you mean?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
She's in here?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
How? When?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
You were saying?
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
His dick was in his mouth?
You know.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
I want to rent a movie.
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I like to expand my horizons.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
What did she say?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, what about Veronica?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Am I right or what?
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
You still didn't have to choke me.
How do you figure?
To talk to you.
Do you work tomorrow?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
He's got those love handles.
You know him?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
I am not.
Are there any balls down there?!
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Oh... Can I help you?
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Here. Now leave me alone.
At least they weren't lit.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
You're kidding.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
What were you doing?
Oh, you think so?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
How many?
HOW MANY?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
What the fuck did you do that for?
It was only a few times...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
You open?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Did he say "making fuck?"
Is he staying here?
Really?
Sure. How about the beach?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Dental School.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Jessie!  Are you alright?
The money!
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
How're ya feeling?
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Two...
Four...five...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Enough.
Where've you been?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
It was great.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We might be able to go that way.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
What about you?!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
He never hurt anybody.
Right.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
I don't trust him.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Yes. They want to help.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
So this is the young man?
Fine, sir, fine.
What would you like to know, sir?
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
What do I want?
I wanna be sick.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Fucking hell...
I was quite enjoying that.
What's all this about sin?
You're keen on music?
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Sir, 655321, sir.
How many to a cell?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Shall we go to my office?
You like being a lawyer?
But not now?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Annie...it's Max.
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
What?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
I was with Max when he got the call.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Quite an achievement...
I brought you flowers.
You're kidding me.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He'll keep calling.
...why is everything always about you...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
You prefer nights?
You - you killed him?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
What about that?
How about the thingy next to it?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Music.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Collateral damage.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Max?  What are you doing?
Show up for what?
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
In case he asks.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Who's Heller?
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
You're going too fast.
Slow down!
What happened?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Are you crazy?!
I was only going one way.
Saved you last night's, too.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I better get going.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
You saved my life.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
That's it?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
What are you doing?
Shoot.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Now what?
Connecticut.
My father's house.
Did you kill my father?!
Love at first sight?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
I believe you.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Do I know you?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
<u>Why you</u>?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A dog.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Night after that?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
We've lost contact.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Dr. Arroway --
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
You know why I'm here.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
David --
Do you have a minute -- ?
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
J39 Z186...?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Can't we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
So who -- what -- are you?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Hokkaido Island.
I'd say this is slightly different.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Ellie.  Arroway.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- are you okay?
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Spoken like a true believer.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
I read your book.
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
So.  The final countdown.
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
They don't believe me.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
But --
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Oh my God...
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Here, Captain.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Whatcha got?
But there's still daylight left.
Somebody say somethin'?
Well, whatta we got here?
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
But -- but --
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
Yes.  Without question.
Who are you?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
She's supposed to have it.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Is it an ongoing case?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
We've got another one.
But it's a different m.o.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Who's the married man?
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Tell me what to do!
It's a woman shot in a car?
Don't hang up!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
How about I put Nikko on it?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
What the hell you need her for?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Where were you?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Isn't that rather too close...?
What is it?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe.
What's all the dreck?
I gather he's late as usual.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I'm really not that hungry.
Yeah?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
What have you done with the ring?
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Just checking.
Yeah.
Wow.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
This must be Beast.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
What is it? Are you OK?
I guess we need to talk.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Are you all right?
Especially now.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
What are you doing?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Zero.   That's all I know.
They left about a half hour ago.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
Hello?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Okay.   How much?
And?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
For what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Why not just steal another one?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Do they come with batteries?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
I will.
Why haven't you turned us in?
A thousand dollars?
Yeah?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Just find them!
What hotel?
They don't have a wine list.
What about transportation?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
How about Canada?
It's good.
Give it to me, Sami.
Yeah.
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
You ever hear of jet lag?
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
You're back!
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Why do you want to teach me?
And if I use them to kill you?
You're home late... or should I say early?
You're already a thief.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Do you know her?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You're not married, are you?
You're doing calligraphy?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Give it back!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Go.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Good.  And how are you?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
You were enlightened?
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
No, not yet...
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Don't you want to see her again.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
What happened?
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
They're gone.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
What in the hell... do you call that?
You buying?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
They couldn't do anything for me.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Mister Funboy.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Get it?
Coupla more rings... 24k.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
That thing is poisonous.
An unexpected pleasure.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
I have his journal.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
The Fountainhead.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
That's also none of your business.
And you promise to abide by it?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
What?
I don't.
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
German.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
What do you mean?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
That's great.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Who is it?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
He made you give him a blow job.
It's like a secret society.
Excellent.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Want to join me?
Don't you want to change that?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Whoa!
Yes!
Pleased to meet you.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Sorry.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Why not?
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
Exactly the opposite.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
Tell me all the details.
Some other time.
I'm not in the mood.
Ronald?
Ronald? That's crazy.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Right after we played backgammon.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Oh, hello.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
I love the smell of pine.
Did you ever make a wish?
Did your wishes ever come true?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Where is everybody?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
What's funny?
That's the Farren house.
I got lots of presents.
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
Certain wishes do.
Now Amy
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
Irena. But who are you?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
But you must!
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
You?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
The Headless Horseman --
Hide me? Why?
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
No.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
There was a sale.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Translation: a total geek.
He's a very talented musician.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Do you really need these?
I think she broke the skin.
George bit you?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Hey, did you get contacts?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
At least your PMS is over.
Are those Mark's?
I wonder if he's married.
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
What happened to his tooth?
DON'T call the police.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
What choice do we have?
Fall in love.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I know.
I do development for TV movies.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
It's a matter of life and death.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Script coverage?
No.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
When's the last time you saw him?
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Yeah. Maybe.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
You at least owe me the truth.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Be careful!
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
I'm going to take a shower.
I think I'm a werewolf.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No, it was our first date.
We can get a warrant if you like.
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
See he was cheating from the get go.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
What is this place?
Was that for real down there?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Iím your new assistant.
You typed this report?
People...  after me.
Go on.
What now?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
Where does it lead?
Someoneís after me.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
What are you doing?
Why?
What is it?
How much do you usually get paid?
First Lady...
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
Where's the girl?
Nightmare...
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
Check his kids.
It's a homeless shelter.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Uh-oh...
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
In the car.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Dave...
Gimme a quarter.
Alan...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
You're leaving?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
Are you hungry?
Well I guess...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Please....shoot me.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What is it?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
It's because of me.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Charlie Dalton.
What do you mean you don't know?
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Well, sure!
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
I have to go home. Chet might call.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
LOUDER!
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
Too bad.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
She won't even see me, Pitts.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Look at this.
Want to come to the study group?
And now he will?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Come on, that's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Oh..
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Visit from my father.
Who are you?
And what? These things are octopusses?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Where are my men?
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Who gives a shit about aft?
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
I'm not a thief.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
The "come back" kind.
Like cattle...
What's the matter?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
You want ME to go up there?
Where's you friend?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Yes, Albert?
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Who's full of shit?
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Let's go!!!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
No, I --
No. None of that.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Rough, huh?
You Biederman?
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
What kind of beer would you like?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
No-o-o!
What are you doing?
You seem... disturbed.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
That way it sets.
Fucking A.
Pow?
Is he from here?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Promise! You gotta promise!
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Forget Sal.
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I like it, Nick.
No.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Did you go hunting.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
The fuck I did!!!
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You okay?
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
I drive.
I'm ready.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Can I ask you something?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Yeah.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
You treat her nice.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Yes.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Who are these people?
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Anybody can see that.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Mama!
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
What do you want?
Stevens!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Now run along, Daniel.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Why of course --
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
How much?
Down, Shep! Down!
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary -- it's gone.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Jabez!
Worried!
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
You know that, son.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Ma -- is she? --
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Come in, Sheriff.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Me?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
You mean -- a jury trial?
I want someone to talk to ...
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
What's happening?
The code key, please...?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you're an American?
New York...
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How long?
Yo!
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Encourage them to be bolder.
I...have a request.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
What are you doing?
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
How do you know?
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
You'll be okay.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Jenny?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
So... that sure is something.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
So!  Sal is with you?
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Yeah.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
Who's this?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
What?
Calm down, you're not ...
Sonny, be reasonable!
The girl hostages.
What the fuck do you want?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Yeah ...
You're full of shit ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
I want to talk to him.
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Hey... let him out!
What if I take you with me?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Thanks again, Sam.
I didn't eat any pizza.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
Goddamn women...
It's the cops.  Shit!
You mean that?
He wants one.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
What?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Okay - you got your one.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
We can't stay here.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
You could give up.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
So what?
Yes.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.

You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
Something is going down. Something bad.
We are so fucked.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
Talk to me.
I'm gonna leave now.
What did he do this time?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Mookie.
You the man.
Make it plain.
It's been about a year.
How long?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
My name is Eddie.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
D, not C.
Let it be broke.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Before I get off work.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Shit!  I forgot.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
What?
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Mookie's OK.
You really think so?
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Take it easy, Pop.
But I came here to learn about America.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Excuse me?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
One day they'll find a cure.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Where did you learn that word?
Collins is a great man!
Can he do that?
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I kinda screwed things up.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
George Washington!
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Hey, it's Jessica.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
What? What did we do?
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Guys, this is much better.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
The one on the left.
She's one of a kind.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
You had some questions.
What?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Sure.
Okay.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Obviously.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
God, I've missed you.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Knock knock.
Are you going to kill her?
My Lord!
What happens now?
So, this is Leto the Just...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Yes, Sire.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Remove her gag!
Is he....?
Run!
Are you a Fremen?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Will we see a worm?
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Voice again.
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Greetings.  I am the Count.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Really?
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
What's in the needle?
Bela, are you ready?
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
What happened?!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Um, okay... roll camera
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Wow.
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Will he be okay?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
How long have you been doing this?
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
Hello.
You look beat.
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Stop!
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
I'm really sorry...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
You're <u>sure</u>???
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
You thought it was me?
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Sure.
They tore her dress! ...
Ed, do you want my advice?
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Eddie? ...
No.
Hey, he cheated on her.
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
What happened?
Hi, Mom. 
What does this mean?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Ha!
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Go!
Really?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari, I really like you...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Everybody hates me!
There's a list.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
This is going right up your ass.
I'm doing all right.
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
... Ray?
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I was in jail.
Hi.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Can I help with anything?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
How?
Yo --
Tu
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
But you haven't written your novel.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
Having a problem with your eye there?
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Larry?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
I guess you know why you're here
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
What a surprise.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
What is it. Tammy?
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
Could you get this? I can't
More this way.
Hey Yeah?
Three twenty-five.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Who put you up to this?
What do you want?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Somebody hit you?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
How'd she meet Patchett?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Did they deserve it today?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
So you saved her.
I want to know about Exley.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Was it... a rat?
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
What do you mean?
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
And?
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Ed, I want confessions.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
<u>No</u>.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Glasses.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
It's a simple question.
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
What's that for?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What are you going to do?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
A vulgar term, but yes.
No.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
How about White?
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Where will you go?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Around.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Brill?
What'd he say to you?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Okay.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
None of your business.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
Goddammit--
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
Feeling lucky?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
It's a little late for that.
I know, but--
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Because my life is being ruined.
You tell me.
Anything at all?
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Hey.
Uh-oh.
Bobby!
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What?
Have you been working with Rachel?
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Is Eric in school?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
You don't know who the fuck--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
Do you like fish?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
Never.
How can I be sure.
Thank you.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I know.
That's temporary.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
I don't under--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
She can't talk to you right now.
Some of 'em.
Who won the fight?
No.
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
He's heard that it's escalated.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
They're framing me.
Jerry--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Are you okay?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
What?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Am I to understand--
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
What about--
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
Daskylus…
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
I'm impressed you can sew.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
What else?
What do you hate most?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
It hurts too much.
Shall we be all right?
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
What kind of photographs?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
How are you?
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
Yeah, for a while.
Where did you find that?
Have a drink.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
How?  How can you see anything?
He's Canadian.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Kip - come and dance with me
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
This is hot!
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Yessir.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Katharine!
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What are you talking about?
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
I don't want to waste your time.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I've got something...
I didn't expect you to be so...
Do you mind?
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
We going somewhere?
You want me to pick up a painting?
He says they turned the card down.
Lose something?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Nice spot.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Got it.
To us. To the Mask.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Your share.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
What's that?
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
He looks familiar.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
The key to success is using the right tools.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
You look like George Washington.
This is just show and tell.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
What the hell is this doing here?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Jesus.
This is a real nice place you got here.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
Oh, my God.
Five million dollars?
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
So what made you think it was?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
This is the only thing you found?
And you can't?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
How many families we talking about here?
What now?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
I want my fucking money --
Is that what you want?
What kind of things come up?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Counts?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Ho - ly - shit.
I did.  Both.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Ross.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Annabelle Daniels.
You want my number?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
That's Ed.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
No, I need my car --
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I'm embarrassed.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What?
There's something else, too.
It'll be fine, yeah.
You're moving away?  When?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Who's Baxter?
Oh.  Oh.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Soon, Lord Vader.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Barks at Han.
Barks at his master.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
... Like we're being watched.
Give me that!
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
I do not!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Probe?  What probe?
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
This ought to be good.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
I'll take what's mine now.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
We've got to find Luke.
Closer?!
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
This hyperdrive had better work.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
I don't believe it.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
But tell me why ...
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
May I say something personal?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Ooww!
Give it.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Oh Cuervo...
He's... near.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
All right, so I made another deal.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
Get this crap out of me.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Getting ready to invade.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
All of us?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
He can be no other.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
What book is that?
What?!
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
I left it in the tent, sir.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Who does it serve?
To me? But why?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You provoke me, Merlin.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
The oath. You didn't say--
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
It's-
Hi
What did the doctor say?
May I ask...?
Would you like some more coffee?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
There is nothing.
Excuse me Miss?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
So, what causes this?
Chris MacNeil?
Where?
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
To begin with it could make things worse.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Is she gonna die?
What did you do today?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Where?
Captain who?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Well your thinking's not so good.
Oh my God!
Hi Chris. Great party.
Where'd you get it then?
Goodnight Dims.
You just missed them.
Do you like films?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
Where's Regan?
No now.
You speak Latin?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Dimmy, you worry for something?
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Save your servant
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
The Lord be with you.
Shut up!!
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Really?
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Yes
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
How old are you?
Is there someone inside you?
Is it Captain Howdy?
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
Yeah, come on in.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
What're you saying, Charlie?
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Maybe next time.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Well, look at this.
Beasley.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Piano.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Twenty years, Ma ...
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
So we on tomorrow night?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
We gotta go, Jack.
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
Your older brother.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Nice, huh?
No?
What was it like?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
I'm not unhappy.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Where the hell is she?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Get out of here.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Why would I mind?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
How's it coming?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
Funny, huh?
You saw wrong.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Couple years.
A useless talent.
What do you mean?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
What?
You weren't there.
Jack!
Looks like these got a few years on them.
How're your hands?
Charlie called.
The audience was a little off tonight.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
How should I take it?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
What's the problem?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
What do you think?
Fucking.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
You play all these places?
Wow. You ever see her again?
Got another song for us?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Thanks.
No.
Don't worry about it.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
You never sang before?
Fucking.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
So why's he do it?
Can't sleep?
You're upset.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Frank said ---
Yeah... No.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
What kind?
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
How do you know?
Oh?
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
How'd the show go?
Jack.
Big piece or little?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Jesus Christ, Castor.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Thanks, Pollux.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
I'm late for surgery.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
What do you mean?
How is he?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
When did you start smoking?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You've got someone in your office.
Castor's escaped!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
You merciless bastard!
What about me?
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Just following your example.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Where's Jamie?
I'm going to the powder room.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Adelle?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Do you like kids?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
She is relentless.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Got a minute, Jack?
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
Like the dress...?
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
Are we...?
Are we finally being honest?
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Are you okay?
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Here you go...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Thanks, Jack...
No?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Our life in a nutshell...
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Jack...can we afford all this?
I promise, Jack...
To Paris. Paris, France.
You can’t go!
Don’t get on that plane!
Mrs. Peterson.
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I found it!
Those yours too?
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I had it at four.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What the --!
We had a tough year.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
I'll be watching over you.
What do you want, Vic?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
Apparently I can disappear.
Sweet.
Then what is it?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
What is it?
-- and why we need you.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
Right, sir.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Then how come it worked loose?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
What do you mean?
We can't take a second more.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
I've done all I could with the laser.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
You said there was a quick way out!
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
A what?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
I don't believe that.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
That's right. And we need more money.
We need more -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Any others?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Yah, he -
Both of these.
Yah.
Yah.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
You know what a disparity is?
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
...Yah, okay...
Yeah, but -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Well... yah.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
...Dad?
Stan Grossman called.
Are you calling Stan?
Norstars.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, I just -
Carl somethin'?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Yep.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Oh, my.
Gustafson's accountant.
Whose car?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
It's just the three cent.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
I'm tellin' ya.
There's no one else here.
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Is that your blood?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Why are you doing this?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I'll take the parasites.
Looks like this is goodbye.
In case we want to switch nights.
I'm just on my way out...
This could go on for hours.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Where?  Here?
Uh ... nah.
When?
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
Guy or girl?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Who did this to you?
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
It's getting exciting now.
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
I don't... think so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
What?
Okay... Ghandi.
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You want to finish her off?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
... Marla ... ?
What are we doing?
Tyler...
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You have jobs.
...to let this happen!
Yes...
You want out?
Tyler...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Ain't that something?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
S-S-Stuff.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
What about that?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Another premonition?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
What's going on here?
Tell me again how it started.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Whoa, nine months?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What on Earth are they doing?
"It?"
This place?!
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Remember the departure time?
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Get control of yourself!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Yeah.  Why not?
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
I've seen worse places.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
We'll check it out.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
You better take off.
Where did you find this clown?
Intelligence work.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
What was that?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Black.  No sugar.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Who're you?
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
What?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
But..How could that happen?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Where you comin' from?!
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Now what?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
I need a drink.
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Do you follow her every day?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
.....What are you doing?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Holdin' my penis...
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Well, it's enough for me.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
No, I...
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Okay, Ray...
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Bobby...
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No. We have tomatoes.
Tea.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
You always do this to me.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Daddy's very ill.
How long have you been staying here?
What questions?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
You're leaving?
Why?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
No inner feeling.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Where are you going?
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
No, I wouldn't.
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Not now, I'm busy
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Wussup?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So what's her name?
Come down!
The one with the phat ass?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
You looking for somebody?
You here to see somebody?
You sure?
You wanna do somethin' with me?
God I admire you.
I wasn't asking.
Hey, what are you doing?
What? What are you talking about?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
So where do you know Alan from?
Two bs?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Mrs. Smith.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
You're in the Records Room.
Here you are, Doctor.
I guess not.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
We can't talk about it here.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Why don't you try suicide?
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Yo!
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Why do you keep doing this?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You ordered it here?
I mean put clothes on.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Can I ask you a question?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
So?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
No.
Don't worry, I can take it.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
They just left, sir.
One.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Muchas gracias.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
Tell the cops.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Who's Frieda?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Now that we've broken the ice...
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Did she tell you anything?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Hey, they blew me.
It's red, Ford.
Let's get serious...
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Zuzu, wake up...
My axe!
Ford, you were right!
Ick.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Are you okay?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
I tried to help you...!
It's me.
What are you running from?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
What's fine?
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
It doesn't have to be like this?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
'Bye, Johnny...
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
You don't use shit?
Got a wife named Angie.
What's your name, asshole?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Sale boulot.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Des Moines.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Yeah!
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
No, you?
Toy wit' this will ya.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
You got the warrant?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Timezit?
Hey, Bo.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
No, I don't.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
You're shitting me!
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
Damn.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Frank, we need to talk...
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Okay, start pedaling.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Where are you transmitting from?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
You call your son Little Chief?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Dad...?
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
No wait, don't go!
Murdered?  Why?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
He took your wallet?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
John, you there?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Sull!  What the hell!
My father didn't die in a fire?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
You're not looking too good.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
She makes ten.
Got a minute?
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
You used to be on the job?
Nah, just working the job.
Sullivan?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
No more... I can't!
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
And, what about us?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What are we gonna do?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
What're you doing?
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You don't "have to."
I thought that was the end of the song.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Is that all you found?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Never should've let her play.
What?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Yes!
Well, let's hope not!
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
Anything else?
Look, I don't want your money!
You need to leave.
Steven buggin' you?
Hello...
Maybe you should be moving on.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
That's very colorful, chief.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
She's beautiful.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Are you crazy?!
How many times do you want to hear this?
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Steven!
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
What murders?
Right.
But I thought...
Christ...where's Rennie??
Dear Christ...
Jason's here in New York.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
You have no right...
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I demand to know what is going on...
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
You pushed me...
Everything okay?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I got you a present.
We must abandon.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Very dangerous.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
It's just a review.
I think we Nought to wait.
You say we go?
I'm not ready.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
What?
Shoot him.
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
She is kicking you out.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
What else?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What else?
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
I'll have whatever she's having.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Who is it?
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
It's the kid's lucky day.
You're charming the boy.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Then say it.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
They're my team.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Why?
Yes, Peter.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
Endearing.
But you're his friend.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
It is the work of untouchables.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
What are you doing?
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
And Jinnah?
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
From what budget?
What are you waiting for?
At least it's nothing contagious.
What about this?
It's not too late to back out.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
What makes them think that?
If you say so.  The stripe.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Where are you taking her?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
How are you, Jerome?
Where are you going?
Thank you.
Anything I've forgotten?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Where?
What <i>is</i> this place?
What about the car?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
--when you go away.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I've got enough here.
Flight got you nervous?
The doctor will give you something.
You gotta be kidding.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I'm in a hurry.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
We'll try again.
Where did you get those?
Half a million.
You been okay?
That's not all of it.
You go out much?
Yeah... I know.
Why are you laughing?
I didn't. I just waited.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
I don't want to go there.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
When we had trouble before it was different.
What?
Where are you going?
Okay?
We're going to make it.
Come on, come on.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Can I help you?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Come on. How much?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
Two years.
Oh ay?
I made a mistake.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
No, don't Jack, don't.
Though nicer than most?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes.
Could you do me a favour?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Is he coming here?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
That's why you waited for me.
You sure about that?
Tell me about the girl.
Did my brother Frank find out?
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Sorry about your father.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
You all right now?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
You don't look it.
And what you going to do?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Now just a minute...
You sod.
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Do us a favour?
Oh, that's nice.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Scotch, please.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Not going, Jack?
Gerald wants to see him first.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
It is.
It's too...
I, I...I...
I...
It's not.
No.  That's absolutely right.
Shoes, boots, yes...
The nurses?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
You...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Should do something to them.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Yes.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
You haven't talked to him.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
Is that what I said?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
You...
Me?
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
They're going to come to everyone.
In the abstract...
I do?
They stole...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Were the leads...
He said we...
Why don't you think so?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Will you excuse...
Did they...?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
Who used to say that?
Shelly: get in the office.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Mmm.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Would you come in here, please?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
I'm out.
I wish I could.
No.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
You are?
Excuse me...
No.  It hadn't.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Abso...
The check's no good?
Don't.
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Shit.
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Shelly...!
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
You're sure?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Monday.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
And when was that check cashed?
She wants her money back.
No.  She told me "right now."
I can't regotiate.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What...?
The deal.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Three?  I count two.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Are you alright?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What if we don't pay?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Would you like some?
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
I understand...
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
We were all upset about that.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
That's what I'm here for.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
I bet you can't guess what happened?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
Within the compound will be fine.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
He's not the same as when I met him.
What do you mean gone?
Why didn't someone tell me!
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
I want it met.
They are everywhere!
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
What the hell are you talking about?
Whose orders are these?
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
You're a considerate young man.
Nothing is more important.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Says who?
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
What's that mean?
I wasn't going to try anything.
It still hurt.  A lot.
Sure.  I loved it.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You did not know?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
You went to university?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Does that surprise you?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
So we understand each other?
Sorry.  Not today.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
No.  The girl.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
Is that --?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
You okay?
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
It seems she neglected to mention it
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
They gave you only four days?
I'm just here about my brother.
Sound it out for me.
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
You'll leave -- ?
I know you.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I'm on the move -
What for?
It just ain't happening --
You ever feel bad about any of this?
You mean the poor --
What about him?
No. That was Higgins ....
How's it going -- ?
You getting my checks ... ?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Hey, Kip, what's up?
Sure -
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Any more ...
Hey, Kip ...
You sure you're okay -- ?
You?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You hear me?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Come here --
Come here -
I've missed you, man ...
What are you doing here?
You boost her -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Shit ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
How's it going?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
On account of Mitch?
Slip it in ...
You remember Junie?
You think it can be done?
Is he still working here ?
Okay, then... Otto?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
What are you doing here, assface?
Which way's out, man -- ?
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Anybody!  You understand?
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
I flushed it down the toilet.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's a fait accompli?
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Oh...
I guess so.
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Jesus.
WILL!
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Some other guy?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Codebreaking.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Okay. How?
--that?--
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Get out, Will.
So who won the bet?
Sean.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Seems like it's going well.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Sean...
Where're you going?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What do you want to do?
Who is he?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could go for a Whopper.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
I go places, I interact.
That's very presumptuous.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
What does?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Watch your mouth.
Why thank you.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Where were you?
They could see that I meant it.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Do you have a soul-mate?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Yes.
Gotta go with the belt there...
Oh, I know.
I know.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
No I wasn't...
You grew up around here?
How was that?
I have twelve big brothers.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I want to meet them.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Do you play the piano?
Will? Are you awake?
I want you to come with me.
I know. I just do.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, I do, Will.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
You doin' the hirin'?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Will ya look at her!
Ready, Pa?
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Lots must a died, too.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
That's not your affair. Name.
Women?
Kids?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
And you ain't ashamed?
Is it fur?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
She's settlin'.
Think she'll hold?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
How about a lift, mister?
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Where you going?
Got any plants?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
When?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Which ones?
They gone.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
How you get all this money?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
What's these?
Now you done it! You busted it!
Morning.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
You don't...
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
It's me. Martin Blank.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Tell me about yourself.
That's it?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Are you going to the reunion?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Watched television?
Yes.
Flowers. That's funny.
You look beautiful.
Do you want to get a drink first?
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Not the other way around...?
I was leaving.
You went to school with these people.
How do you know?
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What else? Say more.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Is that right?
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
He's falling for her. Look at him.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
So what happened to you?
No. You drove us here.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I have to get my head back into my work.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How are you? How's business?
You okay?
What?
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
He's beautiful.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
The answer's no.
Poor thing.
How did you meet her?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
Would you like to see that?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
I'll come.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
What did you say?
Who's going to want me now?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
Why did you go?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What did he say?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I miss you, Annie.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Yes?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
It's so cruel.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Frank's a good man.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Of course not.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
She gonna be long?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
I thought your mom's coming up?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Secret Service!
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Snoop onto them...
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
One-handed!
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
How was school?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Talk to me.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell are you doing?
Name your stakes.
Your slave?
And you have to smile.
We need your help.
What?
Uhhhmm...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Yo, what's up?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
What is he doing in here?
Hello?
Phreak?
You think they're going to bust us?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Send a Flu-shot.
What number please?
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
What's going on?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Brady!
Why wasn't I notified?
Yes.
Has he been prepped?
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Jamie, wait for me.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You won't come on too strong.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Do you?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Its true, Sheriff.
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
It's over.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Saving the treats for Bob?
Shit!
I don't see anything.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I don't know.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Want a beer?
Go get me a beer.
My parents won't be back till ten.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Anybody live here?
A man wouldn't do that...
What do we do?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Where?
TOTALLY!
Hey, Laurie...
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Laurie...
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There WAS.
Promise?
Who is it?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Are you sure?
I've given them his profile.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
Thorazin.
Ever done anything like this before?
I couldn't if I tried.
Oh, good...
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
I love that.  That's my type.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
That's disgusting!
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Hmm?
I can't resist.
You're Holly.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Yeah.
We could...we could do that.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
...with the affiliates.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Yeah.  How are you?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Well, thanks a lot.
How's everything?
Elliot!  Don't!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Great idea.
Where're you going?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why not?
I didn't say that.
Are you?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Me?
What's the problem?
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Oh, Jesus!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yeah.  What?
Yes!
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I know, I know.
Mh-hm.
This is the second opinion.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
What are you talking about?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Okay, okay.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Uh-huh.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Don't you think she does?
He's such a loser!
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
I know, no--  I know.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Oh, God...
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Thanks for a swell time.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
You're kidding me.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
It's all right.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.  How you doin'?
Thanks.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
A reward for what?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I'm looking for...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Bad beat today.
What's new onna street?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
What else did I miss...?
...sir...?
He escaped...
I like Popcorn...
...they're from Baltimore....
Yes, I did.
I am all attention.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I'm an orphan.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
...yes.
If your duty requires it.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Darling...
...long overdue.
...Franklin.
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Indeed we were.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
You should get Married.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Hello....?
I know where he is.
I want the money.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Tell me why...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Yes.
Yes.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
My encounter.
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
...sorry...
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
What in the hell did you do that for?
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Fuck off.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
All right.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
You stupid cunt!
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
What do you want from me?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Did you miss him completely?
We're breaking up. I am out!
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
We on tonight man?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
What now?
Bye.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
My name is Gina!
I'm educating myself!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
But, we're all going to Heaven!
To be known as He!
That.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Sure plenty of times.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Sorry.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
GWEN?
Yeah? You and who else?
Have we met?
You could say that.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
What's wrong, Trev?
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Morgue...?
Hey buddy!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Poor Trevor.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Dreams?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
You okay?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You got a drinking problem or what?
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
The bathroom!  For two days?
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Turn that thing off.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
You never saw that picture, huh?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
What's the matter?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
You test each one thoroughly?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Hey, c'mon.
Was that your dad?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Everything breaks at once.
Do you have a family?
About what?
Baby, what is it?
So you don't have anything concrete?
Have you just plain asked him?
I could take a cab on the way home.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
How were we -- were we cool?
How long does it have to be a new house?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
The cab's waiting!
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Did the cleaning woman come?
What -- what are you doing?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Who was that?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Just reduced.
How large is your brood?
It's fun.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Neil, do you mind?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What did the thermometer say?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
What do you think?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
When did you get back?
She was a good woman.
Yes -- I think it is.
You?
I'm leaving.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
What are we doing here?
Well?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Your life.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Aye?
I cannot stay.
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
Do you love me, Conner?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
To talk to you.
Yes.  How did you know?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
Where will you go now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
You know it's not safe here for you.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
What are you doing?
What will you do?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Jen?  Are you all right?
Jesus.  What is this?
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Talley?
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
Can you identify this man?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
What do you want?
What happened?
I can't go without Thomas.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's enough.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
It's right in front of us.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
I think so.
Who are you?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
What is this about?
Give me it.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
What was the response?
Excuse me, Colonel.
I don't understand.
What is it?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
What do you mean, General?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
I committed no war crimes.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Very good.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
) You cannot kill them all.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Satellite feed.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Where are we going, sir?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
You are the manager?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Who did you call?
Our cards, please.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Do something.
No.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
You could have asked for a favor.
They do not have your connections.
The president has been murdered.
What is it, Paul.
Paul, don't let them die.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
You could leave, Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
It was substantial.
Please, please try one more time.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
All. What do you mean all?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- bullshit --
Looks like we're it.
Oh, for chrissake --
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
There must be some other way out.
Melissa!
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
I'm sorry --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Shit, Pritchett!!!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
Pritchett, is that you?
I'll meet you down there.
Oh, Jesus....
There's always exceptions.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
We can do it...
Good point.
What are you looking for?
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
This is the best we're gonna do.
Don't think it's even an issue.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Jesus!
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
Vannacutt!!
Fascinated.
Well, I don't.
I'll take my chances.
Please! I need your help.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
-- hey! --
For the love of God....please...?
Something....happened --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Good-bye.
Where does this amulet come from?
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Can you talk to her?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
She says she's lonely...
I can't move!
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew more about her.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
...set up some more things.
No.
But do you agree with me?
Oh come on!
A friend?
Oh my God where is she!
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Maura.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
How long will it take!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Where did you find this?
There's something in there.
What do you mean?
Not on station time.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
What?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
But I don't know what's going on.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
That was beautiful.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Hmmmm.....
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
Count of three?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
That was close....
Alex, are you....
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Don't you just hate kids...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Anna, what are you trying to say...
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Oh, you read that.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
I was the Warden?
What have you been doing?
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Catholic girls are scary...
Hudson, don't you understand...
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Oh Hudson...
I wanna know...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
This is the worst night...
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
...The people look like ants.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
I got big ideas, though!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
...Why, this is worthless.
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Oh, geez.
Yessir.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
...Who let you in?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Finally.
I got gas, Bennie.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Yellowstone.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Mrs. Rand...
Does she suffer?
Where were you trained?
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
It is not beautiful.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I told you.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
You wanted to warn me...
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
What about her?
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Right o'.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
You're staring at me.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Don't start.
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
-- What advice? You never --
Good shit.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Hi mom.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
How'd you know?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Forget what?
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What?
What do you mean?
Huh?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
My what?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
I do.
How do you know this shit?
Geometry?
Where you going?
It's freezing.
You get in trouble?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Hello, Charles.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Hood residence.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
I love you.
Just after Leland Street.
So far.
I have to get back.
You did your homework, Officer.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Do it again.
She your only sibling?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Thanks.
We're sure it's hers?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Did she?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
He's asking everybody questions.
Fred Duggar?
Stuff.
Thought I smelled something.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Hey...
You and Kay were like sisters?
No...
She wouldn't tell me!
Thought you might find that.
No.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
What the hell do you know?
Where's your back-up?
You're not following procedure.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
So you have the answers...
I was waiting for you...
But why?
We want no quarrel with him.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
Are these not the answers you came for?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
You were their leader. They trusted you.
Your melancholy eyes...
I'm not your daughter.
Why always on this night?
Stop pestering me then!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Claudia! You did that?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
She's no vampire.
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You really want to be with them?
You're sure?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
It's only a siren...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
How did you do that?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
You loved your wife, surely.
Lestat escaped the fire!
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Listen to me. He's here.
Stupid. Stupid.
The number's unlisted...
Okay, okay. You're right.
Karaoke -- perfect.
No.
Cancer in a box.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Julie...
What do you mean?
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I don't know...
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
I understand something.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Never do that again.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
I'm sorry.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
I trusted you.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Why? He can't help us.
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
He leave you?
Cool.
Can't talk right now.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Well ——
Goodbye.
You're just talking nonsense.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
What are you doing?
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
This girl --
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
Theodosia --
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
George . . .
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Oh, no.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
You know where he lives?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
What did you stop it for?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Ernie!
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
Hi, Daddy.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
There it is, good as new.
What?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
George! George!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Yes, you bet.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Well, no younger than I was.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Some other time, George.
Hello.
Well, what do you know –– wife.
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Why didn't you call me?
All of it?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yes, sir.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Well, I don't.
Eighteen.
What'd you wish, George?
Ouch!
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
How's that?
About what?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Hi.
Is it snowing?
Mary! Mary!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You can?
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
Oh, shit.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Maybe by now they are.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Coming up!  Give way!
Throw it.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Do I have to?
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
Look at that:
Do you?
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Okay, so that's it.
Probably.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
One what?  Ah-ha!
Oww!
No.
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What're you doing?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Where the hell is Air One?
Yeah?  Then what?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Some people.
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
Take a break for a minute, okay?
What about sailing?
But first, a little juice....
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
What about me?
Heading back?
They're turning around.
Michael....
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Wave to my son.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Go on, you're tired.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
What's your plan, Brody?
Thank you.
Well, not much longer to go.
How come?
Are you scared?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Here.
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Recovering nicely.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Come on!
How is he?
That's right.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
Nobody told me.
I can have them walk backwards.
I told you, something's upset them.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Like hell!
I want that shark alive.
Not at all.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
That's because I am the shark.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Believe me, I am.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
I think they'll come out now.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Give me a ride?
I'm a water-skier.
Sure am.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
What're you doing later?
I don't talk that way.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
The world's southern most reaches.
I'll go with you.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
That's impossible.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
You'll spoil her.
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
It'll grow on you.
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
All he did was kiss me....
Michael!  This thing working?
I like Grandma's cooking....
You're coming, aren't you...?
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I enjoy his company....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
It got him....
Promise me you'll be all right....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I can't....
I don't know how....
It's just like driving a car....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
You're impossible....
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
The kind with an umbrella in it....
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I'll get it back next time.
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Matt?
I wish there was something I could do....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Stop farting around....
How many...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Maybe I missed you too....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Where is everybody?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
Okay.. .we're done, man....
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
What about Carla's gig?
You getting a reading on them?
How come only me?
'A Moray eel....'
Shit....
Shove it....
Stop that!
What the hell are you doing?
All the time....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
I'll do it, Jake.
It's my fault...I have to....
Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Woman has taste....
That bad, huh?
Where's Lenny?
I'll take care of it.
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
Be my guest. What you got?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
What about that kid, Ross?
What does that mean?
There's nothing in the files?
Where is everyone?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Stop it.
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Now?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Is this normal?
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
You must have some idea about him.
Have you been here long?
What are you reading?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know what you're like ..
Just your age.
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
What does that mean?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
He's asleep, right?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Wait. Where is he?
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
First you gotta tell me something.
Oh, thank you.
You are not allowed to act this way.
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
No, I air-dry.
Is that your porty or mine?
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
I'm fine.  What's up?
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
They do, my brother.
Hi.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
I won't tell.
ERRR-IIIC!
Do you think it goes all the way across?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
You hate to swim.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
That's him. That’s Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
Eric! Are you here?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
You had the phone the whole time?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
You rented an automated litter box.
That does sound lucky.
How would you classify it?
Hmm?
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Hmmm.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Well that's good.
Billy!
How do you mean?
It matches the pictures.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
How could you possibly?
Where do you think you're going?!
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
We took to the rock.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You version of it.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
There' no reason for name calling.
What are they?
Come on!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
How long will this take?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Okay, who's the jerk?
- - like birds - -
- - a gizzard - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Dr. Grant!
I'm going with you.
That's right.  Will break through.
I know, it's very exciting.
Unpredictability....
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Hola, Juanito
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I read your book.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
These look kind of familiar.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Oh my God!
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Let's go!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
That's not funny.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Hello?
I don't know...
Three.  Where's my client?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
A house?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
You think that's going to work?
He wets the bed?
Oh?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
See this?
Add it to the list.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
You're not going to be there?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
We're down to seven minutes.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
My assistants, I presume.
Have you worked here long?
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Will you do me a favor then?
It's what I'm paid to do.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Are you free tonight?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Gabriela ...?
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Was he depressed?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
Probably not.
Do you?
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
That's <u>mad</u>.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
May I ask where your two warders are?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
All these in the last year?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
I could always apply there.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
Oskar!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Can you fly?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
There's a light up ahead.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I tell you it doesn't exist!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Man Eater!!!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Are you gonna start it up?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Guess!
I do not love him.
Do you always have to repeat?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Yes indeed.
Why isn't he locked up?
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think --
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
He never told me.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Please.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Is that all you have to say?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
You and I -- a relationship.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
I called Trina.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Mm.
You wanted to, or you are?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Some mistake perhaps that --
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Town Police.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Well?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
Show.
When is mommy coming back?
Will she pick me up after school?
Okay...Same as usual...
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want a pizza.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Sleep tight.
Objection.
See.  That's my name.
Is that really your chair?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Your mom.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!
Sustained.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Was he unfaithful?
I don't recall.
Somewhere in between.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
'Night, Jim.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
And?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
What?
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
What are you going to do?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
You're on your own, understand?
You ever think about getting married again?
How many onions does it say to use?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
We must go, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I worry about them.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I will buy them for you.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Cow.
I will be back in a few days.
This many?
How big is Tibet's army?
Is that big?
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
What is the size of our army, now?
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Good day.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Yes.
This is Britain.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
You, kill me?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
It seems like we're getting lower.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
Go!!!
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We'd only just met.
Keystone what?
We are here on official business.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
Is this a trick?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
I can arrest you!!
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where is he?
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
He was an Indo-pacific.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Kelly Scott.
Why are you here?  Really.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Baby crocs?
You okay?  Kelly?
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Sorry.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Thing we can lift it?
Really--
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
What's that?
Are they feeding?
He's done.  He's dying.
Thanks for your help.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Not yet.
What?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
Are you okay?
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Kelly.
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Lecter said a lot of things.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
Are you finished?
You seem pretty sure of that.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
What would it take?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I am, yes.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
It's much better than your shoes.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Your bleeding has stopped.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Yes.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
He kills w-
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
I heard a strange sound...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
The Ottawa are gone.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Mr Poe?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
What is it?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
You still have an aversion to the water?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
Head for... for the white water.
Then what?
And if we're unlucky?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
What a place for them...
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
The honors of war?
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Was there such a thing?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
We're on backup air.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Shut up, all of you.
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Made your million, yet?
Personal effects...
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
Listen to it for Christsake.
You let him get away!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
It's Sixpack!
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Getting some food.
What is it?
Who were you talking to?
What on earth's the matter with you?
It saw us!
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Bitch!  Look what you did!
What's wrong, did you miss me?
A what?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Yes?
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
I thought this was a pub.
Like what?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
There are no others.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Have you counted the money?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Son?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Who was that?
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
It must be this one.
Right, his leg's going now.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
And look what happened to that.
Who's this fat man, then?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
What do you mean?
I think I would rather just turn them over.
I'll see ya.
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Look. Go on, look.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
What's left over?'
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Who's "they"?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
And you and Private Graves--
Nice job.
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
They were in the Army. Like your father.
I got a pretty good guess.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Dad--?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
What?
Right.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
We been through this before--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Senora Cruz?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
That's a matter of interpretation--
That so?
Never heard from him again?
Morning, Hollis.
You thought any more about our murder?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
And my father?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
What?
Time marches on.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
Something wrong?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Wow.
How come it feels the same?
Yeah?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
How much?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Thanks, Billy.
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
I don't want him getting in the way.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
He's a secretive man.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
He's good.
I can be very persuasive.
What did you find?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
He taught all this to Swann?
Are you all right?
Harry?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
Don't look.
Is it finished?
Valentin?
Bad show last night?
And this Butterfield guy--
Are you finished with me?
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Then what do you want?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Leave her alone --
Are you satisfied now?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
She has no real grip on reality.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
... no...
Can you do it?
One question.
Maybe... I... don't...
Nix! Nix!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
And?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
Charlotte, who?
Of course.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
I don't remember.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
That's too scary.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
I know.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm going to miss you.
Charlotte?
You're leaving right now?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Lydia?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Like Japanese food.
Hello?
Hello?
Ok.
I don't know what to do.
John! What are you doing here?
I missed you.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
What a...jerk!
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Is he going to be okay?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So what'd I miss?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Yes, I know.
Nothing yet.
Peter, let go of the chair!
There's nothing else here.
Are you alright?
What about after?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maya?  What do you mean?
He can see you Thursday.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Yeah.
Thanks for handling this.
Thanks again for everything.
She told me she killed them.
What?
What?
Whatever.
That's not it.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
What are you talking about?
Which one for tomorrow?
Okay.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
I don't know sometimes.
Mom's going to hate it.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No.
I told him you looked like me.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I know.  But chances are...
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
What's up?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
You ever think about going back?
One, up.
Your Dad play?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
What?
Didn't know you cared so much.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
You don't look half-bad.
Guess not.
When'd you get this?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Then prove her wrong.
Yo, where's the "D"?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Who was that?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
You weren't at my game.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Can we talk?
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
You don't think so?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
What's going on?
You asked me what was missing.
From basketball.
You're out of your mind.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Zeke.
Yeah.
Not great.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
What?
You hearing me?
Quincy, please...
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Lucky kid.
From your mouth.
After five years.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
No need for braces, Donnie.
You ok?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hello?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
My mother had breast cancer.
Don't sit down.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
OPEN THE DOOR.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
You mind if I check things back here?
ok.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Yeah.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
The gentleman who came to the door --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Yeah.
Eight o'clock?
So you've done it --
Why not?
You really use strong language.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
Well.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Just say no.
-- you the resident here?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
-- what kind?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Can you hold it?
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Is it real love?
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Picky, picky.
I'm sick.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
You mind your own bussines.
I've been a good worker --
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
I need to sit down.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Where are you from originally?
And what did your parents do?
It's not your given name, right?
They wouldn't?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
He's in here.
Is he in pain?
How long...you think?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Uh. huh.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
There's no disturbance.
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
What happend to you?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I can't fuckin' do this.
-- did she talk to you?
But you can't say....
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Do you still have to do homework?
Was it a call back?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Where will the money go?
What does that mean?
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Hello.
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Pink Dot.
Phone number.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Yeah.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
You ready to keep winning?
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
M'lady...?
God smiled upon us.
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Mother -- ?
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How can I serve you in this?
Wh-- Wha--
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
You can do it.
Three days.
Now.  You were saying?
Hang himself?!
Then to the Bastille.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Where are we?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
But -- are you sure?
Die?  What...?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Thanks, but not for me.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
Phillippe...?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Your Majesty...
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Your Majesty...?
I was told this impostor was dead!
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
You've... memorized...?
Did they kill him?
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
What's this?
What?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Zydowski.  It's about time.
Speak of the devil.
Captain?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
What's going on here?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No, but I'm listening.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Tubbs, it's me.
And?...
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I've got a better idea...
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Where?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
How much do you know?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You look all right now.
Get him to Atlanta.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Run it.
What'd it say?
You got the message Lecktor called...
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Where the hell's Graham!
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
What's being photographed?
When do you need it?
How did you come to Gateway?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Is that you. D?
Reba...
Who?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
What am I doing here?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
'No' what?
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
I want to see Lecktor now.
It's Will Graham...
In a holding cell.
Do you know something about that?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's misunderstood.
What happened to them?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
He asked how you are.
What the hell can I do?
If I were?
Me, too. And very erotic...
To do what?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Meet point's up ahead!
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
You went in the apartment?
She got all right?
And Hobbs died?
Pray tell.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Do you dream much, Will?
No.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I don't believe in God.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
No.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
They're having a laugh...
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Five.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Go away.
You're not listening to me --
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I'm gonna quit.
Each show is worse than the next.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
I was very original!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
You don't, do you?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
He had an accident.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
Dead.  All dead.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
No!  It's too far away.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
When?
How did I beat you?
I know what you're trying to do --
Do you understand, Neo?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
I'm going to make the call.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
How did you do that?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Should I be?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What are you doing?
What?
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
How?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
It's locked.
Cypher, I thought --
Tank, you're hurt.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
Get out of here before this really goes up.
You flew before?
Hey, come on...
Panther...
Waddaya think?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
You got some mouth!
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
I think we should see your uncle.
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
OK, ok...
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Michael, give us a lift.
Hey, shut up.
You getting out too?
How much?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Diane, how are you feeling?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Take a drink!
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
No, she's got epilepsy.
"Francis Macomber."
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You know why...with my parents.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
You mean it's heisted.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Yeah.
Did you speak to the Governor?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
-- Black.
Who's Annie?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
I wasn't going to say --
...This shit's not bad.
Red or white?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Toast?  No...just the butter.
...See you tomorrow night.
Drew, you're out of line.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
And what would that be?
We have an arrangement now.
Hot or cold.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
It's going to be great --
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
Whose?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
He said that?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Don' be facety, woman.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I am Joe.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Very well, I'll watch.
And I'll be a visitor.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
No, I'm not.
You first.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
But there's so much to tell you --
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I want to live.
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
Are you going to eat your lunch
And more.
About Susan?
I'm sorry, Bill --
What's okay?
I'll be the judge of that.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Thanks.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Yes.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
You are --?
You want me to be your guide --?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Where are you?  Are you there?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
...There's a start for a meeting.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Daddy --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Why?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Amnesia?
My wife.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
No, let's go.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I like your car.
Do you remember me?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
You think you can bargain with me?!
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Don't say another fucking word!
There's a dress code?
You're the memory guy?
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
What the hell you want to go there for?
Lenny, is that you?
Who?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Who the fuck are you?
Prove it.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Happy now?
Like what?
How'd you know I was in here?
How do you know him?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
* Thank you.							    *
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Yeah?
What do you think?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
I don't know.
So...?
I got the item.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Where's that?
Where's she now?
How's he not your husband?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
What...?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Where'd you go?
Where?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
Never heard of him.
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
On the phone.
Alonzo...!
What flowers?
You mean with the flowers...?
Okay.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
And as an investment in the future...
What do you care?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
Yeah?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
You don't seem like no fag...
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Where'd that come from?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
You got a comb?
They wrong?
I'm scared.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
I read it.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
I'm going to Florida.
Listen, I gotta have money.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Ready for hard work, son?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
'Figgers.
Twenty months?
Want me to take over?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Yeah. How's Mom?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
DAD!
You know where they are?
Those mountains? are they?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Got a family back there?
How much did you have?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Hello, Billy.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Okay?
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
It's already been cut.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Never was anybody like you...
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
You're ayip!
Know what?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Lawyers?
Lady...
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Look, I showed you my badge...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
You feel anything?
Is there a switch?
What do you-?
He's special.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
We're no leaving you!
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
Talk to me.
Hello.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
You want to read it?
What's it about?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Then who did?
Then light the match, Paul.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
What about a bee...?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Annie, what is it?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
You've been out of your room.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
You picked another winner!
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
A change of plans?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Nyah!
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
What can we do' mate?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
What are you doing here?
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
And that's the only reason?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Before you are.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
-- his left jacket pocket.
I managed.
An idea, yeah.
What did you think of him?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Yes, I believe that's right.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I do.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
It's the transponder.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Let's start from the inside out.
A visit from an old friend.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
Come on!
That's S.O.P..
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
You knew about Jim?
Satisfied?
Donít Jim.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
You were in the car!
The message is for Job.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Okay...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire...Hey...
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
I don't quite follow you.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
On what?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Very good.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
What sector's the air conditioning?
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Sorry, am I interrupting?
I'm willing to take the chance.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whatís going to make him do that?
I usually am.
Such a nice ass.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes...  Itís him.
Whatís the problem.
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
The Shawfish?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Have I been a good wife?
Rose, pass the wine.
You haven't said anything.
Here.  Ti amo. 
I'm getting married.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
In a month.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
You're my father.
Yes!
Have you come from my brother?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Loretta. What's that smell?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Why you talking to me?
Yes.
A bride without a head!
This time I was trying to do everything right.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Snap out of it!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
Kinda gaudy.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
You're making me feel guilty again.
This is where we're going!
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
I'm afraid of who I am.
No, I'll tell him.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Hi Loretta.
You never have dessert.
Will you marry me?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Have you told her we're getting married?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Will you live here?
So we'll sell the house.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
WHAT!! She was dying!
Hi.
No.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
He should pay.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Maybe I should go?
That's it! That's the reason!
No idea.
I'm sure she did.
Yes?
May I presume to ask you a question?
People home.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
Yes.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Well, how did you become king, then?
The same!
All right!  What do you want?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
None shall pass.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'll do you for that.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
What is your name?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Ni!
What?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Where?
Oh, shut up.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Well?
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Make a bridge out of her.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
He will be soon. He's very ill.
What is your name?
What is your quest?
That's easy!
Bring out your dead!
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
Well taken, Concorde!
Did you kill all those guards?
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
I done it again.
Bravely ran away, away.
How much?
Sixty.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
And she sent no word down?
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
It's what the maids are for.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
Convey her a message.
What did you say?
By whose authority?
Checked and locked, sir.
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
That can wait till the weekend.
What brings you here?
You sent for me.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Too busy looking after themselves.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Mr Brown.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
What are those?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
John?
I was told you were in a fight.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
I came as quickly as I could.
Then they may read about me.
Is that not enough?
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
This is my good John Brown.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Why was I not informed?
Why not?
I have a letter, ma'am.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Sick?
Nick...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Then where do we go?!
Jesus Christ!
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
What are you looking for?
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
The clock's already ticking.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Go for it.
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
Cool.
Adam, where are you?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
But I'm not broke.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Wow!
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What's wrong?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
I don't know.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
There's nothing?
"Really?"
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Those men in front, in the car.
To my audition.
Betty Elms.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Yeah, what for?
What's  the matter now?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
I had a dream about this place.
You see what I mean...
You feel it?
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
What about Matt ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So what do we do ?
McCay knows ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
You okay ?
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Do you know where you're going ?
That was eleven years ago.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
It's fine thanks.
That's not to tough.
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
You okay ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
But, he's...
When you are ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
One moment dear... 
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
What's next ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Look ! Look !
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
Thank you very much.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Not now, Mom.
I'm talking to you asshole !
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
What now ?
He was right behind me !
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I don't think you're very polite.
THANK YOU.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
You want me to move?
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Seriously.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
What does that mean?
Hi honey.
I will. How's Shelly?
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Special effects?
Hi.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
This is really very nice of you.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
There's water in your bathroom.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
Getting off please.
Vada.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You ratted on my mother??
Boy, you're really into this.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Does it work?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
...I dropped it.
Never heard of her.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Hey look!
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
An adventure?
No?
No problem.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Then you'll be all set.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
He's so tiny.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Wanna play?
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Danny?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It's still available I hope?
Excuse me, what about the job?
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Does it make it easier to win?
I had a good time tonight.
Dance with me?
This is where we are.
I haven't danced in.....
Do you want to?
Kiss me.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Can we see it from the back yard?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
The money?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Hi Vada.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
In the garage.
Why?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
No, no no....
Hi.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
What do you get for that?
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Does he love her?
My Dad was funny?
Who's winning?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
I would.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
I'm hemorrhaging.
I think it should be outlawed.
It's okay sweetheart.
I knew he wouldn't come.
At what?
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
No, I'm going home.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Naah, I don't wanna.
Your lip bleeding?
What's wrong with your eyes?
Who's that with your Dad?
Do you remember her?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Here.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Woah!!
Got it!
Jump in the water!!
Why are you running away?
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Close your eyes.
You better not either.
Stay, huh?
Needs salt.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
He can't do that to me!
You flew all the way h...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Zit cream?
Ben Gay.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
I did what I came to do.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
And the answer was so simple.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
So... one almost has to...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
I never want to go through this again.
Is anybody watching?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
She's too genuine.
Waiter! Check, please!
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Will she like it?
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
The Big Hurt, huh?
Because I could come...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
You got the money?
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You have to what?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
What's wrong with her.
What did you say your name was?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Howdy.
Where are you going?
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Well, Mr. Green.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
He is just wonderful.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
What year?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
How long have you been with them?
And before?
Who is this?
Hello.
Doesn't it have a name?
I'm twenty-eight
Premeditated murder.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
Yes.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Probably a little too long.
Come on.
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Got me an audition tonight.
You sure do it loud.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Who is we?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
You've heard of it?
Who's the song bird?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Describe Mallory.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
I could go for a Coke.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
Hypnotizing.
Yes.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Who?
Are you all set?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
How's it working, Scotty?
Rollin'...and speed!
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
I see.
Ya know, I was.
It sure is.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I know.
Yeah.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
His profession?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Oh yeah?
How about another beer?
They must work on the section gang.
Get out of here!
How come you stay 'round here?
Yeah. Well, I do.
What's he like?
I'll have some coffee, please.
What happened, Duff?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You know how to box?
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
How come you don't hate their guts?
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
What you gettin' all pretty for?
What's so hot 'round town?
They all got families to support.
'See ya.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How 'you gonna live?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Easy...
What's an A.I.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
You've got your orders.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
She's ready to go.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Ready?
Never heard of him.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
It'll flatline your ass.
Yo.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Want to fucking answer them?
Case... are you okay?
What about before that?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Holy shit...
How long have I been out?
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
I'm going in.
I know.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
What?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Now this is cute.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
How about this?
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
I think it's pronounced gauche.
He is totally crunching on you.
You've done five of my ideas.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Do you even know these kids?
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Rob's?
Hey there.
Oh.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Wow. This must be big.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Are you--scared?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Please. Please don't walk away.
That is so sad --
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Wow - I-
We followed your instructions.
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Where're we taking him?
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
Come back here!
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Who told you to choke up that way?
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
What is it?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
So, school going alright?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
I'm serious.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
What?
Good morning, Jennifer.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Jennifer --
Horseshit.
So what do we do about this creep?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
I used to live in this house.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
What's that?
Nancy!
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Oh God.
This is nice.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I'm serious.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
To who?
The truth.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
Somebody else is out here.
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
How is he?
C'mon.
No!
And then I... right.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Here we go.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Floppy, huh?
Busy tomorrow?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
Cartwright.
You like Chagall?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
Excuse me?
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
You were saying...
Sorry about that.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Yes...
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Does the girl have a name?
Where are you going?
No!
Still loves you though.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Is this your first film?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Ahm... room service.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
Does she know you're coming?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
What did she say?
Which was?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Maybe.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Which floor?
How was she?
Excuse me.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
On this ward?
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Welcome back.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
So long suckers.
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
Marry who?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Yeah, where we going?
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
I'll bet a dollar.
Neither do I...
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
It doesn't help him.
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
You can come back later!
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
Hear what?
Yeah, buddy?
Bet a nickel!
Gimme the ball!
I wanna go home!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Is that so?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Got a cigarette?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
A dime.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Yeah...
Hit me!
Yeah!
There they are!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Bet!
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Is everything all right?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Your grandmother?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
No, really.  What's she doing?
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
We found each other, didn't we?
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm a liberal!
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Damon Bradley...
Where are you going?
That's not the point.
How could you do this to me?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
So?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Why not?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
He's out by the pool right now.
Hi, Peter.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
You were saying...
So were you.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Hi.
Yes.  I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
So what do you think?
So, what are we waiting for?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
Is everything okay?
No.
What's he do?
Kate, is something the matter?
It's a miracle.
It's still the new year...
I have vacation time coming to me.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
Live happily ever after.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Ah ha!...
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I never even got to be single.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
And then what, Faith?
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Who said I was going?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Amazing...
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
So...
Kate is that you?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I have to talk to her.
Where is she?
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
But my own kid bro—
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
It was you, Charley... .
Terry...?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
I'm with Terry.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
You know how the Sisters are.
I can get home all right from here—
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Thanks anyway.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
His— racket?
And if you don't?
You haven't finished your beer.
You're not sore at me?
What are you crying for?
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
It's true.
Edie... Edie... ..
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie...
Terry, you're bleeding.
Jimmy...
Am I on my feet...?
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
Where you goin'?
Your gun.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
...walk?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
D 'n D?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
So help me God!
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
Never will be much too soon.
You looking for me?
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I think you could have.
Really?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Is Johnny in?
No advice. Just whiskey.
Terry?  What do you want?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Go on— a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
If I could get my hands on you...
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
I am--It's our only chance.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
She was?
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
When!?
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
I want to speak with you, please.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You didn't visit him in prison.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Do we need him?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Oh, man.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You know they gonna set us up.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
We made it, didn't we?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You excited?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Hello?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Why, are you famous?
I mean, romantically.
You know who this is?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Don't leave me.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Well, does it make sense to you?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You really wear that suit.
So she did help you?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
The fish?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Have they got Midge up there?
The flight?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
You don't remember me, do you?
What's going on, Glenn?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
And is Foley a part of this?
Gee, I wonder why not.
You there?
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Flyweight.
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Midge.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Yeah.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Land of the free...
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Nah, you go on.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
How come you're not pukin'?
Where are we going?
What's there?
We've always tried to beat each other.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Yeah.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Sorry.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
What's your name?
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe --
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
You see us as capable of such a blow?
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
Do you believe in all of that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Do you have to wear that hat?
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Carol!
The only one?
We're going to take you home.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
We're here on the sofa bed...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Looking good out there.
Yeah. Like that.
Charlie, how are you?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
What are you doing here?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
Quiet today?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
I have a note.
I'm excused.
Sort of.
Who was that man?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Where have you been?
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Don't eat the red ones.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you moved into town.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Out?
How long ago did this guy retire?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Just out.
Is this a good spot?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Mom...
What in God's name... ?
What's wrong with your face?
What was the file name?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Thanks, Walter.
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Aren't you giving an exam?
Don't apologize for me.
What's wrong with you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
I'm ready...
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Big trouble.
I buy that.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Thanks for your time.
Who'd you get?
PARRTYY!
I'm a law suit.
What do you want?
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
Particularly, Charles.
Are you a good lawyer?
Do you take risks?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Leave that.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Great.
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Oh, Lord....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
What whispers?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Power cells.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
They're already dead. Get on board.
What do my eyes see?
How many bottles?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
So now you know.
He used that?
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
He can pilot?
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
We aren't completely stupid.
We cannot go through there....
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
I don't suppose....
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Hasan?
The sled as a shield....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
What're you doin'?
Suleiman!
"God is Great," yes?
She's the captain, we should listen to --
What the hell are these?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Very big beads.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
I'd rather piss glass.
Think about that reward, Johns.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Dr. Zaius --
As you wish.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
Do you have to work tonight?
Look -- she remembers.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Well, maybe they're not.
No.
Which direction?
Any particular reason?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Landon! Join the expedition.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
If only we could get a fix.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Gorilla hunters ...
Who put them up?
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Of course.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Stop right there.
Sure.	In a cage.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
You! ... You knew about this?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
It's humiliating.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
I was wrong.
Come on man!
Feel good?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
What you got there - beers?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
What are you talking about! 
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
I didn't like it.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Right...
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think you're drunk.
They might think I was running away from something.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
How did you meet him?
Want a spike in it?
What time is it?
Certainly not to me.
Why not?
Then he's got to be a detective.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Us?
Anything I can do about it?
They're going to arrest me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Please answer my question.
I'm sorry.
What this?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
We try to be decent.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
But even if you were in love with me.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
How are your teeth getting along?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Could be.
In case you want to have us followed.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Information.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
What are you doing here?
Passkey?
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Was that about the right angle?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
I never saw it before.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
And if you didn't believe me?
No doubt about that one.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
Get out of here!
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
To Ann.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Shall we go?
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Congratulations.  Who with?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
In your car
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Hold those rights.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Oh, I see.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Not bad.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
What would you call it?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
You gonna pull?
What's this?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
They don't go for the vault?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Sorry.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Nothing?
What do you want?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
This gonna take long?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Who's the girl?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
You had enough?
Look at you.
Ouch.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Mean anything to you?
Why us?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
What's got Billy so spooked?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
Georgia.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
No, you look like a hooker.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Uh-huh.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Good morning.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
But you want days too.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Did you buy some clothes?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
But don't they have it in English?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Cynthia's not coming?
What!?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Yeah.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Yeah, what?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Oooh, I love those.
I got a dress.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
They will serve salad.
Hi, Barney!
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Having a good time, Vivian?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
You don't believe me?
Brides often are, I'm told.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
But what if something happens to you?
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Why should that make such a difference?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
I brought you a special present.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
What?
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Westley's only faking, right?
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Your guess is as good as mine --
What? What?
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Humiliations galore!
Sorry.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Yes.
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
You're just stalling now.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
Then make your choice.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Yeah, an hour.
Bye-bye, boys.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Here, don't panic.
But that's cheating!
What was I saying?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What are you doing?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
I never should have listened to you.
Don't help me.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Always.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Do it!  Do it!
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
What did you tell the people?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
No.
I live there. Alone.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
I'm in no mood for trouble!
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Please!
Yes.
I still feel...
I'm Mary's sister.
What thing?
She haven't even called you?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
It's been three.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Our Deputy sleeps.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Sorry.
It's regular. Okay?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I can come down next week.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
I imagine so.
Why do you ask that?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
No, m'am.
Mary is Lila's sister?
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Looking for me?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
No-
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Thousands?
But where do the rats come in?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
You here again?
What's that?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
You're losing your blood?
What were you dreaming about?
Did you hear?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But I think these things are beautiful.
But it was really my fault.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Meaning what?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
What!
Let it go.
What do you mean?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
That happens to be the truth.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Is that a fact?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
To lunch.
Shall we unpack it?
Mia...?
I've been dreaming about you.
Why am I doing this?
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Don't mention it.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Yeah, I know.
Of course not!
The new girl is here.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What'd you say, Brother?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Of course.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I am not being brutal to her!
Now you listen to me, Rose --
She hasn't actually done anything...
She does look a little peaky.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Is this ill right?
Strange voices, Rose?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Well, it was a silly question.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
I... I can explain...
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Kittle...
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
What's the plan?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
What's mine say?
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
You live like a pig.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
Maybe.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Can't I?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Yeah... great.
We got him.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
I'm gonna get beside him.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Any preferences?
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
We're screwed.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Are you all right?
The same as always.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Good luck.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
All wings report in.
Oh!
Yes. It's you Leia.
If that is your destiny.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Told you, did he?
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He might be.  I don't know.
Yes Brad.
Oh....Say something.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Wheeling
No no no no.
No no no no.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
What's funny?
Some people are very shy by nature.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
...Guess.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
D'you really wanna call?
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
They're all the same.
Would ya take off your glasses?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Oh, Rocky!
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Don't do that again!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
This a con?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Nine minutes!
Seven minutes!
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I say ya nothin'!
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Ya sure?
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old are ya?
The legs must be goin'.
Did ya win?
...Who'd ya fight?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
...What?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Whatta you get outta this?
How am I doin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Hey --
Don't get mental, man.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
What gaps?
I'll tear his head off.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Now what?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Keep reading...
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
No better?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Farewell, my cuz.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Goodnight.
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
What?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
And so did I.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Meaning, to court'sy.
A most courteous exposition.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
So what's the deal?
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Hazard pay...
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
I'm a patriate.
Are you alright?
Who are you?  IRA?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
We'll double your price.
Do you have it?
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Sent it where?
A means to an end, is that it?
Soon.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
It's been known to happen.
I ride with fat-boy...
Is that right?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
What'd you say to him?
Same thing, isn't it?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
What's going on?
I needed to know.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
And what job is that?
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I never made that claim.
You would have done that?
I'm not here very much.
Time to quit.
What's the story?
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Damn.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Ready to roll, partner?
What are we going to do?
We don't know that.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
That's right!
I've got one condition.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
That's not what I mean.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
He's going to be trouble.
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Dwayne's dead.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
You're worth every last penny.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
So do I.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
What?
I don't know.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
About what?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
I'll settle for a third of that.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Is that the mail?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Yeah.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
What the hell is that?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Winner!  Four, winner!
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Well, hurry up.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
I have plenty of dates.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
It's a long story.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I don't want to hear this.
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Are you okay?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Steamed dumplings?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Very nice.
Hello, Benjamin.
Let's go.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
That your gate down there?
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
What is your name?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Feds asked for me?
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
That silly-ass look on your face.
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You talk too fast.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You like it?
Excuse me?
What a surprise!
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
You OK?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How much they want?
What kind of assignment is that?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You sonuvabitch.
Hello.
Yes.
My daughter.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
You don't understand this guy.
Right.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
Rub your ears.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Or a vegetarian?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Of course we are.  Of course.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
It's nice that they're still friends.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
They made me put my hat back on.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
You're going to be very disappointed.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Too much.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
I don't know.
You look... uh... You look fine.
I'll have the same.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
Yes I do!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Yes, I did.
I'm listening.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Reporter?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
What happened at the luau?
Let's go.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You tell Maggie.
Nope.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You should write something about this.
You're a basket case.
Right.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
What?
I love that dream.
It's a sign --
You don't know who she was, Annie --
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I love the symphony.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Are you Annie?
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
It's you.
Who is this?
It's been about a year and a half.
What are you going to do, Sam?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Is he home right now?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
When's the latest time you were out there?
You'll see.
Write her.
Eighty dollars.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Not.
No, I'm not, but --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Sure.  Looking good.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Will she scratch up your back?
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Dad!
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Jonah!
Don't ever do that again.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Did you call that radio station again?
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
No.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Do you like baseball?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Hi.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
How's Jonah taking it?
You're kidding --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Is he there?
He's ten.
I read an article about this ...
It takes time --
You're welcome to one.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
You know I don't think that.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
Are you Australian?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
Bobby?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Who wouldn't?
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
How?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
Fuck you.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
What do you want from me, Colette?
It gets me through the day.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
How much time do you have?
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Colette, go.
Don't get carried away.
Fuuuuuck
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Can I ask you something?
Danny?
What's this?
You don't trust me?
By not disgracing her memory!
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
What the hell is this?
I've got a hot one.
I was getting to it.
I was trying to score some dope.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Danny?
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
Turns out he's connected.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Excuse me?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Casualties?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
Jackson?
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
Where?
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Not yet.
It's worth it.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Glad of it.
Some.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
Worked, didn't it?
You?  Leading a squad?
Fresh out.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
You alright?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
What do you think?
Uh, oh.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
What deal?
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
Who cares?
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Demolition, right?
How do you do it?
Hi.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
No, no, don't go in there.
Then what's love?
Alright.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Ha!
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Do you love him?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
You think you know what this money is?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
You will?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Thank-you.
Have a good sleep.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Sure I do.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Yeah.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Oh.
No.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
I don't think I am.
It did?
Why didn't you tell me?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Yeah.
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
Yeah you do.
Then don't do it.
You do?
Okay.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
It's your castle, man.
You're freaking out here man.
Yeah.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
What?
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Thanks Lloyd.
I know
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Just her name.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
My car.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man
We're full on bonded.
You know what, you'd like her.
Should I stay?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
It's bad business.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
What's that?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Oskar, good of you to come.
It kind of looks that way.
I was just the accountant.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Shit.
I heard a noise.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
WHAAAATT?
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Fair enough.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
I could use some therapy.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
About what?
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And now, drum roll please...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
So we found a compromise.
We had to have financing.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
This is all too familiar.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Where are you?
You're getting obvious.
I have rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
He tried to kill her first.
What about rehearsal?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
The young girl is slashed again.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
..it's really about family and tradition...
She's not here right now.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Do you work for her now?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Nope.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
What?
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
Off the record.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Jennifer needs me.
Sidney, what happened?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Geez.
Possibly.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
I know!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
You're dead!
WHERE?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Hello?
I didn't kill anybody.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Duh... that's quick.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
I thought she was dead.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Who did you call?
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Yes.
Who are you trying to reach?
Hello.
So why did you dial it again?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I have to go now.
How do you know his name?
I wanna play a game.
Then he dies. Right now.
Please don't do this...
Michael... Michael Myers.
...please... no...
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
I was first to respond.
She's tough.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Where is she?
What? What?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Off the record. No cameras.
Please. You owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Can you see me right now?
I heard screaming.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Don't come any closer.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
Which is you...
There goes my chance with Sid.
Yeah.
Or a man's mentality.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Do you really think Billy did it?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
That's mature.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
It's none of my business anymore.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
What?  What?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
Where we headed?
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You should be thanking me.
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself...
Somerset...
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Not here.
Drop it.
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
You think it was poison?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
It's my wife.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
This is the one thing.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Does this make it with you?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Why would we?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
It is Victor.
Sorry about that... I just...
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
We don't know for sure...
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
How do you know all about this?
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
Are you alright?
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
What is it?
Slut.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Anything... anything missing or different.
It smells good.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Perfect example.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Let's get along...
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
You all right, sergeant?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What good does that do?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
You got any more orders, Captain?
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Ay-eh...They was here...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Told ya, didn't I?
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Keep talking.
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
What you want me to call you?
Nothing for you to see.
Good night...Laurie...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Futterman?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
I think maybe we oughta...
Well, you're a widower now...
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
They'll be back...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
I have to cut his windpipe...
Stop that!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
What?
No, I've never seen him before.
And that is?
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Well, look here!
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Ned…I know…I know
You are a gentleman.
Oh…what have I done?
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We will all be put in the clink.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Most interesting.
And your relations?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
How will it?
Kit
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
And yours?
What is the story?
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
"But new struck nine."
Two hours at prayer!
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Your Majesty
"I know not."
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
Master Shakespeare
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
Who are you, master?
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
My lady!
Oh but why "alas?"
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I am.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
But all ends well.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Good morning, my lord!
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
I'm only asking what you think.
No.
You mean immoral.
You think so?
No, not that.
I won't be able to.
Finished.
Don't you worry about that.
That was good.
What's the problem?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
I want to secure it.
Who?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Is this being recorded?
No. Why should it?
Well, is it?
Sorry to waste your time.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
So we'll meet him, then?
Know and love?
You see, they don't really know me.
David hasn't seen him either.
Maybe he didn't like us.
You want me to kick it open?
I wonder how he did it?
Alex.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
We could put it somewhere.
Expecting anyone?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
So, uh...
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Is this where no one stays?
Is this what they always look like?
Are you all right?
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
That's what it cost, David.
I thought you'd gone to work.
We already know. All about it.
What?
What do we do here, David?
What guy that died?
Here?.
Writing seems easy.
Do you think you could answer that?
For what?
The human condition.
Yes.
Offering it for debate.
Chicken salad.
Do you think George is a fairy?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
-- is that what this is all about?
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
What're you looking for?
I'll be back in a while.
You're late, George.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
-- Anyway.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
But aren't you...
She what?
That headboard.
Like what?
Then it's not your problem.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Yeah, it is.
No shit.
That you're just like your mother.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
You promised you'd do the show.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
I'm sure.
Well, what do you think?
You would?
What's wrong?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
George...
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Don't do it.
-- don't you want to --
-- gee...
Where do you want to go?
-- yeah.
-- what?
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
Yeah?...
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
I have to see you.
Hi, George.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
George --
Now, George --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
You're different.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
Hey, I'm, you know --
Egypt.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
A friend dropped me off.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I've got to get her out of here.
How come you took your own car?
Well that's something.
What difference does it make?
Baby, don't do this --
It's an unusual trade.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Sorry, honey, I...
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
This really ought to be layered...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
Have a drink.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Awww --

Yes.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Who are they?
Hi, Leonard.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
I thought you said things were great with George.
What?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Yesss?
-- uhh-huhh...
Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Sort of.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- there's not much room --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
No of course not.
Call me Les.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Who's Tony?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.
Maybe he showed me something.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny?
Red Rum.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Oh,
No.
To my stomach.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
What sort of injury did he have?
Delbert Grady.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Bill, how do you do?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Yes...
Stay away from me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Mr. Ullman?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Only in a very general way.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
You booger.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
It could have been anything, Marty.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
What if I say no?
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Really.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
What? 
This prom is a real drag.
Hold on.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Shirelles.
What?
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
What?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
We need experience.
Bobs
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
It has come to pass.
And all those like you.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
And the vow of chastity.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
I got it.
So... hi there.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
A vote?
You sent for me?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
You saved my life.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
No nothing.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
I've got to go.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
What're you doing?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
Vince -- is she... okay?
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
Get her!
There she is!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Peace on Earth.
Is this like your old convent?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Who took the meat?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
I manage fine alone.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
What is it?
Thank you.
We should not go much further in this murk.
Did your father take a loan?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
How are you?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
He has proposed to me twice.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
People have put their trust in you.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
My God... what has happened?
What... what are you doing... ?
What was that?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
He rides tonight.
She has confessed.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I don't reckon.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
I'll see you, Bill.
Well, what did you want?
Did you decide, sir?
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Yeah.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
I want to watch T.V.
Stop it, Doyle!
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's all them books?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
Are you well?
Do you like to play football?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
It was still alive when you buried it?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Yeah.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Yeah, I guess.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Karl, you up?
Yeah.
Yes ma'am.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Okay.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what are you, his chaperone?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
And what about for you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
But they're all the same.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
You usually get two.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
I'm all ears.
What do you mean?
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
No you're not.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
A little. Not much.
It's for you.
So I can get my job back.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
No thank you.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Thomas.
Yeah? Who is it?
Aren't you going to say anything?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
What are you talking about?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Mostly what.
Of course. Where else?
Yeah, that's right.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Where did you get that thing?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Thanks. 
Celebrate? What for?
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Hi, kid.
How do you want that cooked?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
I don't know.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Now, Mister Gi...
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
My mom.  Would be the problem.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Greedy.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
What makes you think I play?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
And what's that?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You want me to say that.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Well...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Can I say something, here?
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
I beg your pardon.
Upsy-daisy.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Nellie told us about it.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
Where are we running, Joe?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
My name is Josephine.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Done what?
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Good night, Daphne.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Me?  After Sugar?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
And where's he going to be?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Like when?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
That's some nerve!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Sugar?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
What'll I tell him?
She sings, too.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
You all right?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
But there's one thing I envy you for.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
No!
No!
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
I always did.
Brand new.
Yes, I'm holding on.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Please.  It won't happen again.
Why not?
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
I don't like no witnesses.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
Oh?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
No, we couldn't!
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Running away?  From what?
We understand.
Really?
That so?
Yeah.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Thanks, honey.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
Why?
You collect shells?
Guess!
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Oh - in here.
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
What thing?
Complete washout.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
What'll it be, sir?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
And who runs it?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
Perfect. All ginny.
It was such a long time ago.
Say something. Please.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I thought you said you were crap.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
What’s his problem?
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Nothing, nothing.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
So, what’s your point?
Is this supposed to be an apology?
You’re not even listening.
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Hi. Hey.
Mission accomplished.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Would you grab my shampoo?
You shit!
Is this for last night?
What?
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Like fifteen.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
I always wondered what happened with us.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here it is, right here.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
It's cold, Daddy!
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Ready to go, Mama!
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
What's that you carryin'?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Night, son!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
There, you see?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
What...
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Is it Cartman's mom?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
I can't believe he's dead.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
You're late, Cartman!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Cartman?!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
You've got a stupid accent too.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
Hello there, children!!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Who are you, kid?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Donkey raping shit eater.
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Who is it?
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Oh my God...
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's okay, I am done for.
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Does it say what the clitoris is?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
I thought you had something planned.
Oh, brother.
Stan!
WHAT?
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
The F word?!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Fight the power!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
AGH!
You know I do.
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Oh yeah...
Well I appreciate that.
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
Were you going to give it to them?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
If anyone can hear me please respond!
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Barnes?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
We're going to die.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
Explosive?
Taylor?
Oh my God.  What happened?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Dawn.  Come in.
What the hell are you doing?
Will you marry me?
In that case, I accept.
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
I'm homesick.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
What the hell is that?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
How is it looking, Mac?
Is it safe for human transport?
You a mini-golfer?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
I hate fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Need some advice, huh.
100 years! 
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
The whole world thinks you're underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Hello?
Don't tell me, John.
Uh...over easy.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Nice set-up.
What if he wants to get out?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Where's Junior?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
He's not here.
Uh...over easy.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Do you talk with your mom?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
You told Junior that we did it.
Can I come with you?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Fletcher!  Now!
Wait a minute --
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Norman!
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Nice work, Captain sir.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Where is it?
What was that?
Thank you, Colonel.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Harry's missing.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
You don't think weapons are important?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
What caused it?
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
From the sphere?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
In Edmunds' things.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
You get it straightened out?
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
It's for motion sickness.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
It's like a sleeping pill?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
I'm sorry.
The sphere looks different.
What's wrong, Norman?
How do you feel about snakes?
But --
Yes.
Shut up, Beth --
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Then where's it coming from?
Beth?
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Top shelf, is it?
How's that?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
What?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
When did it come across?
Don't be defensive.
You sound defensive.
C'mon.
Our answer.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
What is that?  That noise?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Norman, where are you?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Beth left?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
Did I kill her?
I can't reach her.
Missed.
C'mon, Norman!
Well, press something!
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
What does Norman already know?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Well, if it's a discharge --
What'd you say?
Norman Johnson.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Squint harder.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Was it a military crash?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
What is it?
Have you been checked out?
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
This isn't going to work.
Is he afraid of the water?
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
See Threepio... do you copy?
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
No, this hurts.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Please continue, Sergeant.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Profile's wrong... there.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Well, whad'ya know...
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
None at all... We won.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Do you mean it ?
What's wrong with you ?
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Uh, look, Diz...
What ?
It stinks, you goin.
Well, see ya.
C'mon...
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Well, yeah, sure...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Let's go.
Don't be a hero...
Mister Rasczak ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The examination is a normal function.
Disclose the information.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Mr. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Hold station.
One hundred kilometers...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Why aren't you on board?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Go you Huskies?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Why?
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
But why the dalmation?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
Hi.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Hello.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Fix my glasses.
Gonna' be good as new.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
What's the scene...
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
That's right...
Where you going?
Good morning.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
And I might have something important to tell you...
Ten thousand dollars.
I have to tell you something...
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
He's on the ph...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Waterford, Vermont.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
The prices are going up.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Nice town that you've got here.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I'm very sorry to...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I want you to hear this.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I love Jewish men.
But not that <u>way</u>...
You have to hide.
Will you help me out...?
Claire, when did you...
We're just talking about the...
This is Joe White.
I know that...
What?
Wally...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I know...
...yes...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Hi.
I'm looking for the writer.
Mmmm.  You have children?
He saw the accident...?
He saw the girl in the car...
I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Not now.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I know the feeling.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
No, what is it?
<u>Siddown</u>!
You didn't see it...
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
How was your flight?
It's just a formality.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
<u>Find</u> it.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
...not at all...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
You think so?
We have to lose the window.
Why?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
Mass hysteria.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Scream.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
That happens.  To families.
I hope it's the right kind.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
And what do you do wh...
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
You lost Ben?!
This is my house too!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
Great.  Big ears, too?
Uh.  What is it?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
You know, this horse smells really bad.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Mommy's sick, guys.
Find the bird cage?
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
It's not good enough.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Something's up wi...
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Me too.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
We...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Get out!
I don't know wh...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Did I hear the word...
I don't, but...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
She's devastated.
And you said...?
Can I look at the pictures?
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Ben never mentioned it.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Not yet.
It's forever you know.
I needed some time away.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Really? How many?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
No, you don't.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Twinkeys!
Marty...
Ready for tomorrow?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
Reconceive.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
Fuck!
The same. Same as what?
Get the hell outta here!
Hey, Mikey!
Nigger.
So what's going on?
Anything I might know about?
You a pervert?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Now what?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Well Filmore--
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Enjoying the tour so far?
What about Cooper--where is he?
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Are we adrift--
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Can I have a glass of water?
Thank you, Admiral.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
You know the regulations well, Major.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
I don't think so, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Right.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
And you'd like to see that?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Then this is it.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
They can't touch us at this height.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What do you mean?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
I'm okay.  What's up?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
It was pretty bad, huh?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Slides go with it.
Uh-huh.
Typical male.
No I quit.
Yup.
It's really not about anything.
A cloud.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Sounds like a bummer.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Sure.
What?
Yeah, man.
Ah, you know people there?
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Your his publicist?
Am I fucking him?
Score! Yeah!
He paid you man.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Thanks. See man?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Hi.
A Porsche.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
I know. It's okay.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Hi.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, w-what happened?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
You lied to me.
I don't know.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Jeff! Come up here!
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Oh! Trim it!
Was that supposed to be me?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
It was a racial incident.
Okay, what would you have done.
What?
Of course.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
My goal is to make art.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
No, I don't.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Pony.
Good, man.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Get off my roof!
Oh!
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Could you give me a ride?
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
Holy shit.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Hi, Jack.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
I know, but that was before.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Is that you down there?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
It's from hunger.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
Check.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
What has Artie to do with it.
It's just impossible.
So do I.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
May I say you smell real special.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
What happened?
Hello, Betty.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Who else ?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
What scene?
Cut away from me?
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
The other guests?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
When did he say it, Norma?
Have one of mine.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
Wanted what?
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Paramount studios.
What is the scene? Where am I?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Don't leave me.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
This is my favourite place in the city.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
We're from different worlds.
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
But what if---it wasn't real?
Wait. Don't leave me.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I bet they do.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
I know it.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Hey, where you going?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Can I give you a lift?
Someone's chasing him.
Yes.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Where is Earth?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Your hair looks the same.
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Where is inner space?
What is this place?
I was on Earth...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
Mr. Roebush?
Brad?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You're welcome...??
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Peanut butter and jelly.
He really was!
Well, aren't you excited?
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Name?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Columbia.
Wipe 'em out?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Is this blackmail?
Is this whitemail?
How you doing down there?
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
I know, by computers.
Who is she?
Why do I have to do this?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Thank ...you.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
What terrific story?
Lots of things...
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Oh, Superman!
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Yes! This time we got it right!
Hostages?
Are you okay?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
A "complimentary corsage."
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Where were you?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Lois, someday --
But . . ..that's terrible!
What??
Gee. But --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
I like trees.
This way Lex.
It has everything.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
DELETE IN CUTTING
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
He has powers as we do . . .
You must be freezing.
So --  I hope you like it.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
You are master of all you survey.
General --- ?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
You're late. Very late.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Oh . . . my . . .
Gee, I'm really sorry.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Is he for real?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
But he's never there.
What's he going to say?
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
A hot story, huh?
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mom...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Stop him, Clark!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
What now, my love?
Big night coming up?
You're just jealous.
Is that what they're calling him?
Listen...thank you.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Again???
Bet he makes it.
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Ready?
They stop for nothing.
I don't understand.
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Boy!
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Well...flashlight?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
It must feel great.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Where do you hail from?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
What is this??!
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
She's in trouble?
What happened?
I hope she gets better.
My name is...
Are you sure?
I don't know.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
From what?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
You've talked to Billy?
What do you think?
You hate it.
You want a cup of tea or something?
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
How was it?
Is this mine?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
No.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Dolores.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Do you have a room?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
Crafts.
DADDY!!!
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Do you have the blood test?
Are you a reporter?
How does the family survive?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
I was scared.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
You remember this?
How do you like it, Nicole?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
He's somewhere...
Come on boys, break it up...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Sidney is a liar!
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Can I come out?  No.
Match me, Sidney...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Uh huh.
How?
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
What does that mean - integrity?
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Bribing me again?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
This sort of thing!
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You ought to be used to me by now.
What's the matter?
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
You're talking very fast.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Please... let... the kids... go...
Where we going?
Can I stop by my house?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Affirmative.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Torque wrench please.
Alriight!!  My man!
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Where do you stand on all this?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
So, what does the Russki want?
You bet.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
You live here, in Berlin?
You do shorthand and typing?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
What's in those files?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
How come?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Tough, tough!
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
What telegram?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.
I'm sorry.
I have illegitimate children.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
How can I know such a thing?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Major.
Yes, you remember.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Anything else?
What do you think?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
There's so much...
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
What's he like?
I'm sure.
Bag some Z's?
That's where we're going.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
Kyle?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
A girl.  You know.
So much pain.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Send a unit.
Call her.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Oh, God... !
You've got to be kidding.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
Please...
I'll wait.
You deserted me.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
What is it?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
No!  I'm sick of this...
What is this!?
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Get us out of here...
What do you think you're doing?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Where'd you get that... ?
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
You look good.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Tell me where we're going.
What's this all about, Connie?
Who?
How do you mean, exactly?
How do you know?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
How long will these take?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
You don't need me...
I've been so lonely.
Dinner's in the oven.
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
What makes you ask?
Not much, I think.
What's this about?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
What's happened...
How concerned should I be?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Luke, can I talk to you?
It's not going to hold your weight.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Well, this lot is full!
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
All right...
And then what happened?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Why do you need a chain like that?
Yes.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Watts?
David.
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
Why?
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
How they goin', kid?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What.
You think I'm staying?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Who done it, then?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Do you have any friends, man?
What d'you say, Elaine?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
Weren't you on a television series?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
On what.  What makes you so certain.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Only in the movies.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Where's Big Sur?
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Hey.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
What's in it?
How we gonna get that lucky?
So why would he want to see you.
You've made it ... brighter.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Pleasure.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
What.
...Yes?
Ann--
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hi, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
But more or less.
You're an enthusiast.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Ah yes, a music lover.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
She's a rare one.
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Where you going?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
...I don't get it.
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
...Huh?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
...We goin'?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...I'm Crane.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
His eyes are open.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Lieutenant --
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
What happened to them?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Dr. Green has to see you!
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
What are we talking about here?
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
This room sucks.
We're not supposed to go back there.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
I don't understand.
Genetic damage?
You're not.  Where is it?
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
Hide quickly!
What happened?
I don't believe it.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
Why is he in the basement?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
That's correct.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You take Japanese.
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
Stay where you are!
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
Where have you been?
Oh, God.
What do I do?
--we need more charcoal.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
How are you, Mother?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
I think that about does it, Spooky.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
What is it you find incredible?
This man's still alive.
Of what?
Yes.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Do I know you?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You know my work?
What killed those men?
Negotiating with whom?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You didn't know my father --
No. I haven't.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
What? What are you talking about?
You said you weren't coming?
What did you find?
He didn't mention a park.
This looks like new grass to you?
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
What?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
What do you think it is?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
What? What happened?
Cold...
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
...give a kiss to Edward.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
What then?
Agent Novak?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
They're hungry.
You liked him?
What now?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Nervous?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Agent Novak.
That's a secret.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
So?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Who are you looking for now?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Do I...
Oh, that was many years ago.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
...you know.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Harry.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
...parents.
That's the reason.
He works in a military hospital.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Him dying like that.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Miss Schmidt.
Do you see what that means?
I suppose you don't believe me.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Be sensible, Martins.
It's a military hotel.
Very good, sir.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
What's that?
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Unwise, Holly...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Dr. Winkel?
Could he have been at all conscious?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Excuse me!
...Popescu...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
...give evidence.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
Third Man.
Mr. Martins...
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
I'll share something with you.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Bonjour.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
What about Moliere?
Bonsoir.
I think so too.
Exactly.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
No one follows that midrash.
What's a fascist?
You coming?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Who's Linda?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
That's a much easier game.
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
And? WHat did you notice?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Those aren't Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
It was a nine millimeter.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
I don't do that.
How have things been going?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Hello...?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Who knows what that is?
Which one were you aiming at?
This will be a different kind of device.
Oh, what is this shit?
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
When do you want it to go off?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
How?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
You missed on purpose.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
You're leaving?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
Good afternoon.
You know each other?
This is a great pleasure.
Where did you two meet?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
... Not yet.
Is he alright?  What happened?
How did it happen?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
And where did you say you were from?
And... does the voice come back?
Why?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
No.
No.
Why?
... Everything.
Two years younger than you.
You don't have that one, do you?
He doesn't like us.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Don't you have a heater?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
You look adorable.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
... No?
Hello?
What?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... And the new stereo.
How was your trip?
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Will he understand Spanish?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
There won't be any need for that sir.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
So, now what?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
So don't show a picture.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Anything else?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
How do we bypass it?
Hammer, you alright?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
What should I charge?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
So, how was I?
Get off of me you cripple!
This is for "mama and the kids."
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Then what do you do?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
They don't say it to me.
Where's that man?
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Love is different for different people.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Come to look around?
Some crazy guy.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Why did you give up teaching?
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
State hunters?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
That's easy. Me.
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
Who was the other man?
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
——	As long as my feet held out.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
We stood here once before.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
That’s right.
That might depend on where you’re going.
Who is Friedman?
Are we understood?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Mr Lombard?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Crow what?
By your Austrian?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
What am I to do with the packages if...
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
How many of you scumbags are here?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Where is Friedman?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I don’t.
Is this Friedman?
What is it?
What are you talking about?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Evening. Table for one?
I’m sorry...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Fine...
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Welcome to the club.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Better today than tomorrow.
Who do they think I am?!
What did they say?
What's going on?!
I'll go.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
One day you will.
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Go onto the next question.
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Trial?  What trial??
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
... and what... what did he say?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
... as always, majesty...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Do you know how to count?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
You don't believe me anymore?
What have you done to me?
I don't know... I thought...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
They won't come anyway.
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
"Love your enemies"...
But you already confessed this morning...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Him?
Who is this "he"?
Beautiful.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I don't want to wait for his call.
Someone you know?
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Really?
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
When's your baby due?
Let me see this.
Have you seen this?
Henryk's in there.
Can you help?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
It's not funny.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Otherwise what?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Where are you hiding?
What's happening?
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Which mountains are those dear?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
No, words. You have never heard words?
You have to wash them.
She wants to see what you can do.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What?
She wants it to come.
We can't leave the piano
He's given it to us.
You the owner here?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
Yeh, go ahead.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
We cleared 22 here.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They're still looking for him.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
I'm not sure I know it.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You want a drink or something?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
What is this?  I got work to do.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Yes.  He admitted it.
Why not?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
She's got me worrying, too.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Well!
Mind if I look around?
I can't.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Don't.  It's horrible.
Oh!
You know, we know each other.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Dorothy. 
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I know -- I know --
But it isn't bad weather now.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
I never saw him before.
Ask him.  I don't know.
What about the suicide?
You've been there?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Who're you calling?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Could this be him?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
That's ridiculous.
But he's interested!
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
Where were you?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Oh, he's sitting up.
Oh, please, Nick.
Did you get my money?
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
What am I?  The fall guy?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Isn't that my drink?
No thanks.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
I'd like to see you work.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Sit down!
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
What things made you so sure?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Yes!
Who do you think did it?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
How did you get in here?
You worked here?
I just wanted to tell you...
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Not much of a pass.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
You got no reason to do that!
Get off him.
Stop it!
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
Wes--
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Just keep quiet.
Give it to me!
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Steady it out!
She okay?
It'd make their heads explode.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
Don't!
A whole lot of nothing.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What if he's not?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
Wonder how the war's going?
Just let me rest for a second.
What do you figure it is?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
Is that good, or bad?
Why haven't they killed us!?
Can you ride a horse?
How do we do that?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
People are suffering.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What is this?
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You get it yet?
That's in two days.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
If there's gold.  If!
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Maybe we should give him some water.
I think he wants something to drink.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Stress category.
Drug evasion with....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
It's the end.
THX!
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
I'm leaving.
What?
Which way?
We've lost SEN!
What was that....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
May I help you?
They're not here.
And you are...?
Who the heck're you?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What're you talking about?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
So what were they doing here?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
This is where the van was parked.
How long are we going to stay?
Right.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
What's up?
How do you know?
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Good, now the other side.
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
You got it.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
What do ay say?
Jesus...
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Why are we stopping here?
Who are you calling, sis?
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
What about the ballistics report?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
You don't fish.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
I'll do it.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Yes, sir.
It's our only option.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
And harems ... ?
You're looking fine, Major.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Like it?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
But not now.
Yes, m'sieu.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Monescu.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The pepper, too?
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Right.
Two fifty-three, five--
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Now, Lily--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
That's what you need!
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Oh? 
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Then riding together.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Then a little nap--
Marvelous.
Crimson!
No--yours, madame.
Any minute I want!
I'm crazy about you!
Then why do you want to go?
Thirty-three--
Lovely.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
Two lumps, madame?
About what?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Your bag?
Yes, I saw it--but--
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
An accident?!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Is this in any way unclear?
This should be amusing.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You're a good liar.
You know somebody?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
So, you got a name by the way?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
What is it? A sapphire?
You're trembling.
You have to go for help.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Rose, get in the boat!
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
No-o!
Where'd you get it?
No gentleman would do that.
I thought you were one of my friends.
Yes--are you?
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Where have you been hiding?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Don't be a c-a-t.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Don't let's talk about it.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
A dollar forty.
My change.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Thank you, sir. 
About sixteen hundred.
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Come in! 
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
I thought you were a sucker--
That goes two ways.
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
How about you?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Here's your fifty.
Here you are, sir. 
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Hello, Denby!
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
What for?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
I went for four.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
--you'd go with him!
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
That's the truth--every single word!
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
So how's Tombstone treating you?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
I'm retired.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Age quod agis.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
You don't even know him.
Not exactly...
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Very instructive
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Praise Jesus!
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
You're a little touchy about it.
Doesn't suit you.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
What's wrong?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Wyatt!  My God...
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Come up to the fire, honey.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
'Least you admit it.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
There they are.  No herd though.
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
I just got it fixed.
What about all these saloons?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
How did you get this number?
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
...And what's that, my dear?
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
His newspapers?
It must do something.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Natalya?
Can you arrange a meeting?
Sidney Winch, meet -
They point, I shoot.
... Kids?
Have we met?
Nice to run into you again.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Sometimes you just have to -
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Sleep well?
... Yes???
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
What do you make of all this?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
What's your name?
How is it now?
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
What is HE doing here?
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Why don't you come in for a while?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Who is it?
Harry is coming to pick me up.
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I'm worn out.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is the garden doing?
What did you put on it?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Harry, you know everything.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
How is he doing?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Those boys never did have good luck.
How many people do you all feed?
Some people grow up and change their ways.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
What are you doing?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Wow!  Cool!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
To infinity and beyond!
Yeah?!
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Here!  In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Hello-o-o...
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
What's going on?
According to my nava-computer, the --
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Woody, stop it!!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Shhhhhhh!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Are you peeking?
What?
Hey!!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
That ain't no happy child.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
I got it, Woody!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
W-w-w-we?
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
Reprieve.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
He's not here.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
So my wife is lying?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Hi.
...How old are you?
You do?  What else you do?
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
I'll put this in the back.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I don't think you're going to do that.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
One question.  How did you find about this?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I got money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
What?
OK. Same again?
What?
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Diane.
Sorry.
What?
Come on.
Jesus.
I don't see why not.
Holding hands?
No.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
Are you getting out much?
Following the game at all?
You take the test?
That's nice.
Have you got any gear on you?
Thanks, Mark.
Now remember --
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
I don't rate that at all.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Did he -- you know?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
How much?
What's on the menu this evening?
Sounds great, Swanney.
How long is it?
Where did she come up with that?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
With a starship!
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
No, no, it's not possible.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
Bob?
Yes, Captain.
Not General Korrd.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Is it possible?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
I am here, Captain.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
...mark two.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
What are you doing?
I trust your message was received?

Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Your old files -- ?
Did you say Group 7 access?
Did he say why?
I want to go to his place.
Flynn!
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
They'll start to soon enough.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
Yeah...?
That all you can say?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
You said it.
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
User requests are what computers are for.
Yes?
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
A User -- in our world?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
Watch it!
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Yes, MCP.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Yori... hey...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
How?
My quarters.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
You seem fine now.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Copy that.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Guy's a spook!
She's still at my house.						*
She's lying.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
He's got it.
So, it was your first time.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
And you agreed?
I think so.
What did he give you?
Are we going to die?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Beat it.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
That was you?!
Tell me what happened?
You can trust me completely.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
And you chased one?
What's happened?
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
The letter I sent.
Bye-bye.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Like it?
What's that?
You know when you sat behind me?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Was it him or you?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Clarence?
It's great to hear from you.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Clarence sent a letter?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
You're really in love, aren't you?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
What do you think, eightball?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
No. Not yet.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Why does he trust you?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
I really don't know.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That Vietnam movie?
Do you believe him?
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
What was I sayin'?
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Put it in your pants.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Yes.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
No, sir!
Him?  You saw that man?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It's just a shot to calm you.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
They're keeping an eye on me.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
I don't understand what we're doing.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
That a fact?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
You afraid of the dark?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Where in Mexico would you like--
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You own this place?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Hey!
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
No charge.
Two-hundred.
No!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Jake, what is that?
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
That a fact?
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Lied?  What do you mean?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Grace . . . Grace?
Let's do it here.
You got a suitcase?
John . . .?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Are you all right?
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
The trunk.  It's locked.
It's . . . it's locked.
I have half a mind to--
You've got to be--
I'm a solid man.
Hey!
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
That's a bit much.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
I came to kill her.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
What are you babbling about?
Two-hundred dollars.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
The old lady?
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Got any cold soda?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Hell no!
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
What the fuck do you want?
You've got to be--
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Would you?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How much could you get?
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
I came for Grace.
What happened to your hand?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
You Harlin?
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Great!
Hundred-fifty.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Look, Harlin.
What you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Got any cold soda?
I call the sheriff.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I like that about me, beautiful.
No, I've got it.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
A medicine man?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Where?
I wanted to talk.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace ... Grace?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I'm not sailing his boat.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Morning, officer.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Genuine Draft?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
They look nice.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
What's the matter?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
I axed you a question.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
When was the last time I wore pink?
Megan?
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
I'm not sure.
What about the game?
Why?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I thought he was carrying something.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
I have to go now.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Are you finished?
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's doing well today.
When?
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
I'm going to go in.
I'm sleeping in my room.
You like sports?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
You told them cowboys you had it.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
He give 'em names?
Are you really going to kill them?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
All week?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
Maybe I ain't.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
You're goin' back with him?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
You... gonna take... the money?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Shit.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Yeah?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Easy, Bill.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
That fella come by... Tom.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Did you... did you... ?
No... I meant...
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Far enough.
More.
Fuck you.
His pistol must of jammed.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
We done that stuff.
Jack. What are you doing here?
There was ninety-one million -
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
How do you do?
What the hell do you want?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
What fence? Who?
You have to come.
I'11 be alright.
What is it Keaton?
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
A little of both.
What do you mean I can't see him?
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
You got him wrong.
I don't know about that.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
Then what?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
You're joking.
Mr. Abraham...
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
We thought it was just.
Yes.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
Say it.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
We went to Code Blue...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Orthopedics?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
I didn't do too well for you.
Dr. Gruber ...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
You know what happened.
Then why don't you testify?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Are you done?
Exception!
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Maybe I can do something right.
I've got to work...
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What are you going to do?
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Been a long time, huh...?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...yeah...good...
What the hell are you doing here?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
What?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I want to buy you a drink.
It's a long road that has no turning.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
How long have you been back?
And you like it.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Hello.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Just let me talk to you.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Then will you for me?
Just dinner.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Will you, Judy?
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
We're going awfully far.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
What are you going to do?
You don't remember.
When?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
-- talking to you...
No.
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
Why did you jump?
No, I can't tell you!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
Would you know the room?
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
No... we're together...
Why?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Here you are.
Out. I've got things to do.
What have you been doing?
Well...
Jesus.
How ya doing?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Don't point at me.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Bury her out in the desert.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Don't talk to me about character.
What?
Who? What are you talking about?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Have you thought about what I said?
Money?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Okay. Hi.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's in there!
But not tonight.
What's goosed?
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Oh God. This is insane.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
You're a fucking moron.
Not true.
Stop.
May we have the rings please?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Can't we do it on the phone?
The wedding cake check?
You forgot the tent?
Why did you forget the tent check?
How do you figure?
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's a great chef.
That's absurd.
Will you please call the chair people?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Yeah. Nesting.
Go have fun. Not too much.
What about the chairs?
What's the word on the chairs?
This is our honeymoon.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
He kept saying he was protected.
What?
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I'm not breathing right.
Where did you get that?
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
I guess.
Pup corn?
"You Send Me."
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
Right.
I'll come to you tonight.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
How did you know about that?
Yes, it is.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
You must think I'm mad.
Unfortunately ...
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
How much is that?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
Me?
It's very good.
Ramona! Ramona!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
What are you thinking about?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Are they going to work here too?
And ...your friend?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
There's been an accident.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
What about you, Manuel?
What happened to me?
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
What happens if I can't catch him?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
What did Cox pull him out early for?
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
A little less than yesterday.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
I don't need a baby—sitter.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
You all right?
What are you doing?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Give me your wrist.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
How did you find out about the toxin?
Nice work.
Can I ask you something?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
You okay?
More or less.
The symphony of collision...
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
...tonight...
...on the way in.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
What crisis?
Yes
Yes.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
No rain.
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Our adopted land...
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
War's over, Pal. 
...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have <u>flower</u> or a <u>bear</u>...?
Give'em another pill...
Stanley, you can't do this....
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
"...where's my pill..."
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
We're due at Andrews. 
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
My name is Ronald Brean.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Why do they go to War?
...Yes.
Is there a press conference today?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
How much...?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
Who?
What do we have that they want?
What?
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Mmm.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
No, I'm On Top of it...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Don't tune it too good.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Shoes, Hats....
I have the White House on the Line.
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
Just want to take a nap.
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
He's lying.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Sell?
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
I guess it's time to hit the road.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
...thanks Natalie.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
So, where are we going?
Yeah, right...
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
So what's the problem?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
Know the name?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...isn't it perfect!
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Anybody want another drink?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Hello?
Can I give her a message?
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Then why do you still like her?
Come on.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Of course you will.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
What?
Why is he worried?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What?
How're you holding up?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Hello?
That's not...It's not like that.
Would you like some iced tea?
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
What's your name?
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
He was so pissed.
You should have heard her play.
How you holding up?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good.  So you're human.
Jody--
Know what I think?
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
Oh...
Does Norman know?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Adamant?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
Jody he was lying.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Whatcha reading?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
How are you?
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Tired?
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
Did she say that?
Why?
Claire?
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
You didn't?
He killed her.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
When you do this, I swear...
There we go.
Norman...
I never said...
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
How did you--
I'm sorry...
What?
You don't remember?
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Claire, please don't...
I never asked you to quit!
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
She did it.
We have to get out of here.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I'm cooking you dinner.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
What?
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:Would you stop it!
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Yessss...
My jury's still out on that,
Just one.  The bar's closed.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Harder...
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Hello...?
She - she said I - I was a ---
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Wanna snack...?
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
When aid you get home last night...?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
On which planet...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I thought you were someone else
So there is only one key...
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
then why did you marry her -
You've killed but you're not a killer
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What's wrong with you?
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
You'll never believe who's in there.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well?
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
You're way ahead of me again?
Son.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
You do know how to drive?
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
James, what are you doing here?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Wow...you clean up nice.
I see.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
I mean my father.
That's probably my office.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
What about you?
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
You were the new and improved you.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
Yes?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Merritt, Forensics.
About Suzie?
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Then what?
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Maybe she used another name.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Guess I kind of lost it there.
Where's the body?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Yes.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Oh, Ray... no...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Thank you, Jimmy.
A ride.  You want one?
It's those rocks, up there.
I say something funny?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
What are you looking at?
Is there some reason why you're here?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
He... Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Kelly...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Say you love me.
I'm running away.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
I just want my life back...
Come on, let loose!
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Where is she?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
No.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Sam, for godsake.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
What?
What's wrong?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
No.
But don't pull that again.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Limestone quarry?
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Now, what was that?
All that jumping and kicking.
Can you fill me in here?
This is good.
It is?
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
French?
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
You're not that big.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
Because she's sick.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'll help you...!
She's in love.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
She's a bird, Willow.
I don't know, Willow.
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Ouch!!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
I'm not going in there.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Milking?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Nail it!
Have you got your gun on now?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Whacking?
But not a good tired.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Buttons are Hochmut.
But Stoltzfus said...
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I got there late, John.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
You hear me?
You know where he is.
You admit you're lying?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
John said you're Amish.
God, Fred...
That has no place in this house.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
No, you listen. Get out!
Is this where we're going?
Dorothy!
Yes.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
To see?
If she?
...resourceful!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Yes --
Oh --
Oh --
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Where do you want to be oiled first?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh, my!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Um-hmm.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
...along.
Yes -- there --
And you're going to lead us.
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
Dorothy!
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
That's right.
To Oz?
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Well --
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Stop that dog!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
Is there another way?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
We’ve got to get out.
...yes?...
Construction’s not exactly my line.
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Who is it?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
She’ll get over it.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
Then take me with you.
I’m coming with you.
Was this all about the oil?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Where’s the sub going?!
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Warm.
This is the end.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Why?  What's the problem?
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Had a lot of blood in him.
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
She's with me.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
His what?
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
Old?
-- What is it.
What?
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
Dan -- what do we do now?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Where's Laurie?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
No comment.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
You do everything Yorgi says?
What are you?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Where's he headed?
Toadies right behind.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
The Peace conference...
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
I can see that. Why?
What...?
You're serious?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Logan, do you see this ring?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
What am I doing here?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
He helped you?
Is that what you're looking for?
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Darling!
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Promise??
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Love me?
What a strange fellow.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
That's a tough choice.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
Well... we'll see.
I didn't do that.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
The wockers with the knockers.
What is this place?
Do you have the name I wrote down?

It's always been one of my favorite names.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
All right -- where is she?
Thanks...for all your help.
I'm a failure.
Get the sedative ready!
What's that tune that you're playing
May I see your violin?
Inga!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Look, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
Right here?
It wasn't me.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
What?

Are you ready for me?
I'm getting tired.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Do you have a reservation?
Foooooood!
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
